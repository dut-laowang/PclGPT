In order for life to have intrinsic meaning, that meaning must be found within the thing in and of itself. Life, itself, then, must contain its own meaning. Otherwise, it's not the ""meaning of life"" but the meaning of whatever the thing really is.

So, if the meaning of life is God, then God cannot possibly be the meaning of life at all; God would be the meaning of God, and God alone. God is not intrinsic to life. In fact, if you're a believer of the bible, God existed before creation, so God is not intrinsic to anything. God precedes everything.

"The best thing you can do is learn to plan your dive and dive your plan.

PADI teaches you how to avoid getting bent. But most new divers won't approach their NDL limits unless they're doing deep repetitive dives (like 3+ dives per day <100 fsw). New divers have gas consumption rates that are simply too high to let them get close to NDL unless they're diving doubles.

You need to learn how to write a safe dive plan, which means understanding how your consumption rate will affect how much time you can spend in the three phases of the dive - descent, dive ops, ascent, while still retaining sufficient gas to act as an emergency reserve for your buddy, and having enough gas left in the tank to avoid dropping below the minimum necessary for the tank to remain in a ""safe"" condition (i.e. 500psi).

Once you know how to craft a dive plan the next thing you need to learn to do is how to conduct a safe ascent. Safe ascents from 30fsw to the surface require you to master the art of hitting a fixed depth and holding that depth without rising or falling in depth for a pre-determined amount of time. Ideal safe ascents begin at 30fsw and increment in 5 foot units for 1 minute per all the way to the surface.

Finally, the third thing you need to do is practice your Out of Air (OOA) drills with your buddy. You should both become comfortable enough with the procedure that you can do it without altering your depth. You can combine these drills with your safe ascents when you're good enough at holding depth to manage it.

Basically until you have reached a level of proficiency with your skills and knowledge about dive planning, you aren't going to become a safer diver.

The Rescue Diver class, by the way, isn't about making you a safer diver. It's about teaching you the skills you will need to respond if someone else has an accident or a health emergency. There are great parts of the Rescue Diver curricula including learning/refreshing CPR and how to make a site-specific emergency plan, and I encourage you to take it, but just remember that the class is about helping others not helping you.

You're trying to tell me that you judge the likelihood of communicated facts being true based on the probability that you think they are true. 

I'm telling you that I based the likelihood of communicated facts being true based on the history of past experiences with the source of the communication. 

I'm not sure why you don't understand this:

1. If source A has provided me with 10000 facts over a period of ten years, when source A provided me with fact 10001, I would assume this fact were true. 

2. Of source B has provided me with 10000 facts over a period of ten years and every single one of those has turned out to be incorrect, when source B provided fact 10001, I would assume this fact were not true. 

What you want me to say is that the details of the facts provided are what I should use to judge the likelihood that information is true. In the event that the fact provided is in an area in which I am an expert (through experience, education, or the like) and I have a set of previous information of which to make a proper and valuable evaluation, then this would be the case. Otherwise, not at all. 

If someone tells me something about which I already know many things, I might feel comfortable estimating a probability of the truth of a claim. But this set of things (the ones about which I know a lot) is small. Most things would be outside it.

I would like to know how your process works. Given that you only believe things are true based on the probability that you think they are true, you must already know a great deal about any given subject before you are presented with new information.

I didn't say it doesn't, I said it assumes that it does. I don't know if it does, and nothing you've said has indicated that it does. But you're right, my initial response to the quote was poor, I think I misread it.

>wtf? 

>Here's where you said you understood that there was no before:
 http 

Absolutely, the way I understand time is that it emerged during the big bang, and thus I'm not sure referencing ""before"" that event makes sense. Not saying it doesn't, not claiming it doesn't, I'm unsure. This is a statement of ignorance, intended to caution against making claims and conclusions while we (humanity) is so ignorant. If you took this as a positive claim, that's on you.

>Ironically, my reference to you saying ""there was some other kind of time"" was about you making a straw man out of my argument. I never said there was some other kind of time, but YOU said that phrase, and pretended that I did, and then ridiculed it. That's literally the textbook way to make a straw man. Hypocrite, much?

Lol this is shaky at best. I wasn't trying to suggest you were saying there is another kind of time, nor mocking you for it.

I'm mocking you for ""countering"" me expressing ignorance by waxing philosophical and then saying ""there's no reason to think there wasn't time!""

I'm concerned you've misread everything I've been saying, which would explain your weird anger.

>When you said ""from what I understand, before the big bang is not a thing"". In fact, your understanding is overstated.

Well, since that isn't what I said.... And I'm more than happy to continue to admit my understanding is flawed, I'm not sure what your point is.

 How again does speculating without evidence of any kind ""counter"" my admission of ignorance? 

>When you say ""so I'm not sure that [...]"", it kind of sounds like you're just trying to be polite when correcting someone. It doesn't necessarily come across as ""I have no idea, here's one possibility, but it's just as likely as any other"", like you're now claiming you meant.

I didn't mean that, I meant "" here's what I understand ( with an implicit meaning that science understands it as such) that time began during the big bang, and expressed doubt that ""before the big bang"" makes sense as a comment. Any other baggage you attached to my statement is you projecting.

"""Well he never made these claims til after MJ died, so excuse me for not rushing to believe him. He was part of the Johnny Young Talent Group, which is like our equivalent of Broadway for kids, I guess, so it wouldn't be unusual for them to hold dance contests.""

This is an attempt to discredit Wade because he waited a long time to report it. This is a common thing to do. The reality is, people who haven't been abused or groomed have a real trouble to understand the behavior of victims. It's common for people in Wade's alleged situation to perceive their abuse, not as abuse, but as normal. These children weren't forced into sexual situations but were coerced and they willingly performed sexual acts. In that way, there is the element of abuse victims not seeing themselves as victims. Often, a big life moment that occurs in the victim makes them re-evaluate their past, in this case it was Wade's baby boy that was born. He had a nervous breakdown as a result.

Again, I can't stress this enough. We shouldn't believe Wade 100% yet, but don't dismiss him because his behaviour doesn't match with what you consider to be a reasonable person - if he has been abused then his behaviour is prone to be different. 

(Also note that not only Wade is in litigation, also Jimmy Safechuck is)


""It's not feasible at all! Michael is an entertainer, of course he'd be looking for the next big talent or dancers to be in his videos. Is anyone side eyeing Missy Elliott for hiring countless children to dance in her videos? Beyonce signed two teens to her label, is her behaviour creepy or suspicious? It's nothing new and certainly nothing suspicious for industry power figures to go hunting for young talent. You'd be accusing 99% of the entertainment industry of pedophilia. Showbiz careers take years to form, then even more time to establish an audience/fanbase. Most stars sign young so by the time they're well known, they're still only 21 or so.""


Okay, point taken, but Wade slept in MJ's bed - Beyonce isn't sleeping with her potential stars. Also, Jordi Chandler and Jimmy Safechuck were not performers - amongst others. 


""If that man is only sharing his room and/or bed with close family friends whose parents are fully aware of the situation and have given permission - which is all that was happening - then no, I would not suspect anything unless given a reason to. Michael even said himself he would NOT let his own kids sleep in a strange man's bed, only family friends. He said the only reason kids were in his bed is because they were too scared to sleep alone in other parts of the mansion and because they asked to sleep in the bed rather than on the floor:
Source: He explains here that he was sleeping on the floor in a sleeping bag, then reiterates that he shared a bed with Macaulay Culkin and his siblings, aka close family friends (Culkin attended Michael's funeral and testified at his trial).""


Again, this is a common issue. Your only source of information, or your main source, is the potential culprit himself...MJ! Of course he's going to say he didn't sleep with these boys. You might aswell not mention that. MJ played the image game - he didn't always tell the truth. Consider his excuses for his plastic surgeries, him claiming he didn't bleach his skin, him claiming he's not anti-Semitic yet he did hold those beliefs (there's a reason he wrote ""jew me)"". He clearly had more than 2 surgeries and it wasn't due to breaking your nose - you don't need to make your nose smaller when you break your nose! It's actually laughable that one flies by. The point is, MJ isn't the beacon of truth - he knew that he had to say the right things. (By the way, don't get side tracked by that, you may well think actually MJ was telling the truth about all of the above but I'm not interested to debate that)

"I have no qualms with this ""main issue"" in A Woman is a Woman or Vivre se Vie because while they obviously include references, the films themselves are not belabored by them. As I said about Contempt in the latter part of my capsule:

>it's so taxingly parabolic that it cripples its own superficial enjoyment. 

Or, to put it another way, I just don't think Contempt offers itself to surface-level pleasure the same way some of his other films do. Just because YOU think Contempt is exciting or beautiful or enjoyable or whatever adjective you want to use, doesn't mean I necessarily do. And quite frankly, I think outside of a few scenes here and there, it's a giant bore that's dragged down by Godard's attempts at over saturated allusion.

I also think his take on things (anything, really) from women, to the government, to the filmmaking industry, to romance, and beyond, often bogs the merriment, gusto, or even on some occasions, the more bleak aspects of his films, and comes off like either (1) a checklist of references and winks and pats on the back, or (2) a glorified PSA. Had the same problems with e.g. 2 or 3 Things I Know About Her.

A Woman is a Woman and Vivire Sa Vie, since you decided to use those as conflicting counterpoints, don't require knowledge of anything, really, although they do contain various signposts, homages, references, etc. They are completely entertaining for their own sake, not because of all the obscure references that Godard has tried to cram into them. The jovial spontaneity of A Woman is a Woman or the formal gambit of Vivre Sa Vie are far and away more amusing -- to ME -- than anything Godard has to offer with Contempt. The scene in A Woman is a Woman where Emile and Angela are arguing with books or in Vivre Sa Vie when Nana is being read the ""rules"" of prostitution -- there's nothing in Contempt nearly half as alluring or arresting or even unique as these moments alone. It's a film that's so constantly concerned with connecting the dots and proverbial rib-nudging that it forgets to actually be lively and convivial on its own merits. 

It's honestly shocking to me that you think comparisons against A Woman is a Woman and Vivre Sa Ve are even remotely necessary, as the sheer density of Contempt puts it in an entirely different weight class when it comes to Godard's personal musings. It's way too hampered with ""nods"" and ""winks"" and if you don't catch a good portion of those (or, choose not to praise a film based on its irrelevant allegorical register, as I have done), you'll find that that its pretty damn hollow otherwise.

"I've seen a lot of work-related feminist ideas prop up (""Women are underprivileged in the workplace,"" ""They're going against the establishment,"" and so forth). The other one I've seen has been the ""Women are strong"" kinds of mentality. 

When does it come up? The former is when people want to leverage their situation. If it's a situation where women do not want to do some type of work, the victim card sometimes come up (note that this is with some very specific and entitled women, which is also interesting because these people end up stepping over pretty much every other human being to have that advantage, regardless of gender).

The latter comes up when talking about policy differences, and I'm not entirely sure to whom they're speaking towards. Because it all sounds so fake. Usually these types of women typically, in the heat of the moment or during some critical leading positions, end up backing off and become useless.

All of these usually come out without any real context. The sexism that a 50 or 60 year old woman has faced is far more obvious and rampant than a 20 or 30 year old woman. My issue is mostly with the 20-30 year old ""feminists"" that have been grasping for whatever ""social justice"" they can to make it seem like their lives are ""unfair.""

"In practice, when you have to argue that your terminology is right ""by the dictionary definition"", it's often because we all understand that it would be misleading by any other more intuitive definition. 

The dictionary exist to sort words out, not to give authoritive guidance on their subtleties. It will help you look up which is ""receipt"" and which is ""recipe"", or what is the greek-based word for ""rule by a few"", but it will hardly help you in reading the social context of which is the absolute most appropriate word to use. 

This subreddit is full of posts where people try to argue that tehnically they are right to apply a certain word to an action. ""Piracy is theft"". ""Abortion is murder"". ""Taxation is theft"". ""Affirmative Action is racist"" ""Avatar is an Anime"". ""Chess is a sport"". 

These arguments often boil down to picking a thing that is partially example of a larger label, but in some ways it is also an outlier example compared to the most iconic central examples that the label evokes.
These arguments' goal is not to bringing up new, unknown information about their subject matters, but abusing the dictionary so a thing will be looked at differently if we categorize it together with a larger label. (No one is raising new scientific data of what an abortion involves, just that we should frown upon it because the dictionary applies the same word to it, as to a man shooting you in the face)

In the case of racism, we all understand, that the term ""racism"" was popularized as a description of nazi politics, and the way it ideologically motivated by a belief in racial hierarchies. Later it got applied to American white supremacist politicians, who rejected the term, taking it as an unfair accusation. So it entered the discourse as that, as an accusation of an intended oppressive political agenda. 

Even if today, you can find dictionaries that for brevity's sake define racism just as ""negative beliefs about a race"", or somethig like that, it is undeniable that the term is dripping with a heavy accusation, that the one called ""racist"" is about to bring back the Bad Old Days. 

Which makes it different from having negative beliefs about a hair color, or about a body height, or about a city of origin. Those are prejudices too, but on a different level from racism, without carrying the same ruinous threat of oppression.

I actually play zombies fairly regularly, I paid for the full game and I make sure to play every mode. I enjoy all 3 and I can still say that adding zombies progression to the current pass is an idiotic thought. The progression system and the way zombies is played wouldn't work together we'll, especially since you'd be spending unenjoyable amounts of time playing zombies to get even one rank. 

All of the modes in the game are worth 1/3 of the games price to me, the battle pass doesn't affect my idea of worth in any way, shape or form. I didn't pay for the pass, they offered free shit if I played specific modes, that doesn't devalue time spent in zombies, it just means they're focusing on the modes that have the highest population of people.

>I'm specifically addressing state socialism

That is wonderful for you, I am not nor have I. You can change the argument to say any specific socialist ideology and be correct, it is an ideology, but I am not talking about a specific socialist ideology but the philosophy of socialism.

>Socialism is when business is controlled by the labor force, rather than by private individuals

Once again you are not talking about philosophic socialism you are talking about market socialism. The philosophy is that the benefit of labor should be given to the one doing the labor. That is where ideological socialism (communism in this case) tried and failed, by having the government own the businesses. As a side note, you are jumping into a rather unfair argument as a philosophy never needs to prove that it works, only that it is what is true, while an ideology needs to prove that it is both the way things are and a way that works.

>If you claim you have a right to initiate violence against someone else, then I should have the right to initiate violence against you

You have the right in this case, however, I have the same right and exercise it far more liberally than you do and with far more people than you can muster. I see we will circle this one a lot but I will repeat myself, might makes right. I have 20 armed people who believe taking everything from you is right and believe you can defend yourself from us. You are one person. You are dead. We are all now slightly richer.

>The opinions and moral arguments of lunatics without integrity should probably be disregarded.

I agree completely, which is why I disregard your opinions and morals. Oh, wait, that kills your main argument about self-ownership again as your morals are contradicting my morals here. Oh well

>Voluntaryism, not volunteerism. They are different things.

Sorry, I thought you were going for a system where a group aids another group, not an indefinite measuring stick that I was already arguing against with self-ownership. So you repeated yourself, understood.

>What? Voluntaryism would suggest that the group that believes ""might makes right"" shouldn't be using coercion, and self-ownership would dictate that the other group has a right to defend themselves against said coercion.

You can scream right up until the 20 people kick your ass and take your things that they shouldn't use coercion, doesn't change that their action was a gain for them and there was no real penalty for them doing so.

>Spontaneous voluntary association and cooperation doesn't require a government. Preventing yourself from being attacked is self-defense, which is not the same as enforcing your views on others.

Again, I never said it did require a government, only pointed out it acted a lot like one. If I have 20 people who say I am right and you have 5 that say you are right, I am right. Just like today, where if over half the nation votes for trump and less than half votes for the dem then the trump crowd is right.

>An idea that has no basis in reality. Ironically, this is probably why capitalism is what is going to bring about the space age. The laws of supply and demand apply, but resources are practically infinite when you consider the scope of the universe. We just need to figure out how to get there.

Everything is limited by access and availability. You can say capitalism will lead you new ventures but socialism does say this will happen when resources are all used at capacity so no real difference there.

>I could see that as an argument if it weren't for the fact that laborers are already being compensated for their work. That's like saying ""Well, you've been paying me for all the work I've done, but now I feel I also own your business. You know... just because I've worked here so long. I mean, it's not like you've been busy managing the business or took the initial risk to start the business.""

I can do straw men too! If you say a person is being compensated for the labor but another person decides what portion of their labor they get you are creating slaves! Slavery is bad! 

To move past that, you argue on the grounds that a person can own the resource which is outside the philosophy argued and again moving into the economic socialist ideology. So, congratulations on a nested straw man argument

Seriously though, can you argue that the more a person works on a resource the more they should earn? You can attach whatever stipulation you want to it but at the end of the day if I put in 2 hours and you put in 4 hours of the exact same work that produces the exact same value you should earn more.

No; there are two differences that came to light since then. The first is that where these stat blocks came from are explained to the OP who stated that he just googled stats and used them. The stats I recommended come from a 25 point buy and I linked the calculator and told him to play with the calculator.

The second is that they're more realistic for a character to actually possess, and easier to roleplay. Having 3 dump stats is a pain in the ass to RP and it's obvious cheese most GMs don't want to put up with. It's an unrelated note to the class nerf. 

The only implied connection is that power gammers gonna get nerfed is a very common thing, but the OP suggested that he isn't a power gamer when he said he googled how to witch.

>Most characters choose 1 or 2 aspects that they are good in, depending on how many good stats they have. 

Yeah, I said that. But they don't choose one or two things to get good at, at the exclusion of everything else. That's munchkin territory (an extreme form of power gaming).

>But what he is saying is basically akin to telling [class x nerf y].

I also suggested not playing a class you know is going to get its tits nerfed off. Especially if nerfs bother you. If playing a nerfed character is going to piss a person off the easiest solution is not to play it. I gave an alternate solution in the form of Unlettered Arcanist who has the witch's spell list (and patron familiar) but still can get a few powerful wizard/sorcerer arcane spells (from having a school) not found on the witch's spell list.

"> We¡¯ve been doing that for months in regards to ToB.
> We¡¯re not asking for huge engine overhauls or features that CA have never implemented. The vast majority of criticism has been about CA removing features that were already in previous games. How is it unrealistic to want them to, you know... not remove something they¡¯ve used in the past? At this point I¡¯ve given up wanting CA to put in cool new features because I know they won¡¯t, so really all I want is for them to just not get rid of things that worked in the past, but even that is a lost cause now.

Not really. In previous months, if you look at certain opinions, there's a disparity in player reception.

For instance, players clamored for an explanation why ambushes were being removed; u/Jack_CA eventually gave an answer after arriving at the office (as he had promised).

In the official TW forums, the reception was understanding - players understood the reason for removing the feature, and were moving forward.

When Jack explained it here on Reddit, the reception was a bit more critical - players did not understand why it had to happen; they kept asking 'why' (even though that was already answered). Some insisted that 'it should be easy to make these changes'; some espoused the slippery-slope argument such as 'what if CA streamlined all features so we only have 1 building and 1 unit in future games'.

Others in a knee-jerk reaction felt that this was a betrayal of the community, or that Thrones was already the worst game in the franchise. And finally, a couple of people decided to call for boycotts because these were 'dark times for the TW franchise'.

So yes - people here wanted an answer, they got one, they were angry because they didn't like it.

-----------

In the old days (cough - 90's, early-2000's, pre-social media/streaming/blogs) - we used to criticize games after we had experienced them, or and we often took critic opinions with a grain of salt. Today, we criticize games after we hear about them from someone else, almost espousing the ideas presented by certain critics - who are, more often than not, fellow gamers like us.

In effect, this leads people to believe that 'removing features in order to focus on new ones' is a bad thing - even though the Saga-series is considered an 'experimental one to look into other areas that TW can delve into'.

Here's a more detailed explanation on how our criticism of games has changed over the years.

And here's another one about how opinions/critique has changed based on the landscape of the media/social platforms nowadays.

-------

> Yep, and that¡¯s why they¡¯re paid to work as game developers and programmers and not fast food employees. You seriously can¡¯t keep dismissing every criticism or suggestion with ¡°well you can¡¯t do it so give them a break¡± or ¡°well it¡¯s hard, don¡¯t expect too much¡±. 


And it's also not an idea of - 'hey it's hard, don't expect too much' - it's a case of 'it's hard, so set your expectations properly'. There's a key difference there.

The moment the average gamer feels that certain steps are easy to do, even though they are not - whether it's due to the game's engine, or programming issues, or the game's overall direction - the average gamer then sets more unrealistic expectations layered on top of the other.

Take a look at Destiny for instance. Gamers initially wanted improvements to the system because the sequel was disappointing; next thing you know, people wanted Destiny 1 to come back. If the developer tries to go back to that system, people then ask 'why it's taking so long', or 'why did they even try to change in the first place'.

In essence - it does not lead to anything constructive because people are still stuck dwelling on the past ('why did these things happen?') rather than providing -realistic and level-headed- feedback that allows the game to move forward.

Here's a topic about how to provide constructive criticism for developers as written by an independent developer. Notice how it also points out how we should assume certain changes are difficult, and that we should not get stuck thinking of the 'why' (things happened).

"I'll try to summarize your main issues:

1. The use of two terms which are likely worldviews of many r/atheists. Not sure why you're still so caught up on these, as they're simply frameworks from which to understand what it is possible to know and how we arrive at such knowledge which leave no room for a deity. 

2. You still seem resolved to defend the position that the scientific method is completely separate from philosophy. 

3. Atheists don't require a belief in any sort of metaphysics.

Responses:

1. I'm not going to type out summaries again. Positivism. Naive Empiricism.

2. Philosophy is involved both the formulation of the scientific method itself and the interpretation of data. Empirical data alone is useless, it must be analyzed within some framework (the method) and interpreted in order to be of any use. 

The method itself cannot be designed by science. Philosophers are behind the details of the scientific method. If you choose to deny this, please give your explanation of how we arrived at the method. This is essentially the same question which you dodged earlier, i.e. name a scientific result which is separate from all philosophy. 

The interpretation of results is crucial to science itself. For any set of physical data there is literally an infinite number of mathematical models which will fit the data to any desired precision. The very idea of an ""electron"" is an interpretation. This concept is useful for asking further questions, but it is an abstraction from the data. 

If we wanted to, we could still use the epicyclic, geocentric model of the solar system to describe retrograde motion. There is no predictive difference between Kepler's heliocentric, elliptical model of the solar system and a sufficiently tuned version Ptolemy's geocentric model. If we work out the details of the epicycles and such with enough precision, the model can be used for identical predictions to that of Kepler and Newton. So why do we choose the heliocentric model? Occam's razor is philosophical in nature.

Beyond the fact that data is useless without some interpretation, in many cases the interpretation suggests new models or experiments. Einstein was convinced that some sort of deterministic hidden variables were behind the randomness of quantum mechanics. A guy by the name of John Bell devised some experiments to test whether or not hidden variables were even possible. This is some pretty far out science, and at this point, philosophical interpretation is pretty much the only guide for forming new hypotheses. 

General Relativity was inspired by Mach's principle. It makes statements about equivalences of differing states which are central to physics, but at the time were nowhere to be found within theory or data.

If you're still somehow convinced that science lives in a vacuum, I can't help you.

3. <---(this is a 3, I do not understand reddit's formatting) I never said that atheists need to believe in a metaphysics. One member of the Vienna circle wrote a paper entitled ""The Elimination of Metaphysics through the Logical Analysis of Language"", part of the reason I mentioned the circle. 

That said, atheists do have to maintain some sort of worldview (unless one is a nihilist), which is the reason I provided two example frameworks. Not as authoritative statements, but to illustrate that pretty much every worldview is a positive assertion of the manner in which things work. There are plenty of worldviews out there that do not leave room for a deity or religion or a whole host of other things. Unless you're a nihilist, though, there is some form of the world which you prefer to believe in. I say ""believe in"", as up to this point in science/philosophy/humanity there is no way of telling which view is correct (or even if a correct view exists).



The only question I have for you is this:

Why are you so steadfastly holding to the positions that atheism isn't a belief and that science is separate from philosophy?

>An example: I invent a cheap, effective cure for leukemia. Is it moral of me to destroy it and prevent the benefit to the world simply because I am its maker? Of course not.

>Creation does not inherently justify destruction on a whim. Therefore, the destructive acts of God must be morally justified using another line of reasoning, or else deemed immoral or amoral.


What about any of the above demonstrates an attitude, and what ""attitude"" is that? Absolutely nothing, as far as I can see. If your problem is that I am being oppositional to your viewpoint, well...welcome to a debate forum. It isn't called /r/BeAgreeableWithAChristian. I didn't use an ad hominem argument, I didn't personally attack you, and I didn't threaten you. I laid out my argument logically and civilly. Your complaints about my ""attitude"" are nothing but a whine. Stop whining. 

>The reason the robot analogy is so weak is because it presents a scenario where the 'created' and the 'creator' are too similar.

No, they're not. It isn't even necessary for them to share any qualities. As long as the created object possesses the traits I outlined, It cannot be moral to justify destruction solely on a whim using creation as a standard. That is why the robot analogy is the correct one. 

>A more accurate scale to Christianity, (or even to OP's premises), would be... 'as a grain of sand is to the Milky Way, so humans are to God'. 

Now you're making a host of category errors. The difference between humans and a grain of sand is that we think, feel, and make value judgements. As long as that is true, humans are moral beings. This is why the robot analogy applies, while the leukemia cure and sand analogies break down at this level. All your argument amounts to is the statement that ""God is such a greater moral being than us that we can't judge his morality."" If that is true, and we have no reference by which to judge God's morality, then you can't determine if he is good or bad. Calling your god ""good"" or ""bad"" is inherently a moral judgment, which, as you've argued, you cannot make about him because of your own limited moral understanding. Thus, your argument has pulled the rug out from under your own feet, and you can no longer say ""God is good.""

Once you lose the ground to argue that ""God is good,"" how do you claim that your god is worthy of worship, if he exists?

> If we accept the basic philosophical definition of God as 'a being such that no greater being can possibly be conceived of'

This is a completely untenable definition. It simply doesn't work.

1) Define ""greater."" The word is meaningless outside of a defined context of measurement. One is greater than negative two in value, but negative two is greater than one in magnitude. What is the essence of the greatness you're talking about? Is it size? Power? ""Goodness""? The word ""greatest"" doesn't mean anything on its own, it is a modifier that must be qualified by a context. Your ""greatness"" is an undefined concept, and so all you've done is try to define your god into unfalsifiability by retreating behind another vague term. 

2) Once you define ""greatness,"" your definition will inherently lead to an infinite regress. Any standard of greatness can be incrementally increased. As such, any proposed ""greatest"" example can simply be incremented again, using the same standard of greatness. This is the philosophical underpinning of the concept of infinity. Our conceptions are unlimited in this regard, so positing God as the upper limit here is nonsensical. There is always a greater infinity that can be conceived of.

3) The Christian god is already defined, and your definition does not comport to the preexisting one. The Christian god is defined by his attributes and actions as outlined in the Bible. That god which is outlined in the Bible is certainly not the greatest being that I can imagine, so your definition forces us to reject the god of the Bible.

4) Even if you can prove that your definition isn't nonsensical, you would still have to demonstrate that the greatest being of which we can conceive actually exists in order to refer to his moral integrity in any kind of sensible way.

>You've referred to humans as 'lesser moral beings', and God as a 'greater moral being'. This is exactly the same error that I made in the robot analogy by referring to the robot maker's actions as moral. It seems that you have already pre-judged the moral integrity of God as well. 

This appears to be an admission that it is impossible to judge the morality of God's actions as either good or bad. 

Humans are moral beings because they think, feel, and make value judgments. This inherently creates a moral framework in which we live. Does God think, feel, and make value judgments? The Bible indicates he does, so he would have to be a moral being. You yourself have gone on about how God is the ""greatest being that can be conceived of."" This definition cannot result in any conclusion other than God is a greater moral being than humans.

>¡°What Have You Done for Women?¡±How Rose McGowan¡¯s anti-trans bias weakens her feminism.

>Last week, Rose McGowan?abruptly cancelled?her book tour following?a confrontation?at a Barnes & Noble with an audience member on Jan. 31. The protester, a trans woman, accused McGowan of not doing enough for trans women and was escorted out of the event by security while yelling ¡°white cis feminism.¡± McGowan characterized the incident as a verbal assault and?complained on Twitter?that her staff and the audience had been insufficiently supportive of her in the wake of the incident.

>This isn¡¯t the first time that McGowan, a former Weinstein victim who has vigorously contributed to the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment, has come into conflict with the transgender community. In 2015, McGowan wrote?a Facebook post criticizing Caitlyn Jenner?which read, in part, ¡°You want to be a woman and stand with us- well learn us. We are more than deciding what to wear. We are more than the stereotypes foisted upon us by people like you. You¡¯re a woman now? Well fucking learn that we have had a VERY different experience than your life of male privilege.¡± When her post was criticized for its transphobia, McGowan removed it and explained that she had only intended to be critical of Jenner¡¯s comment that the hardest part of being a woman was deciding what to wear.

>That largely satisfied her trans critics until last July, when she?appeared on RuPaul¡¯s podcast?What¡¯s the Tee. In the episode, McGowan brought up the subject of trans women and complained that trans friends of hers had never asked what it was like to grow breasts or get a period. She then said of trans women: ¡°They assume, because they felt like a woman on the inside, that¡¯s not developing as a woman, that¡¯s not growing as a woman, that¡¯s not living in this world as a woman.¡±

>It¡¯s clear from these comments that McGowan believes trans women fall short of full womanhood. She points to specific experiences that she considers central to true womanhood¡ªhaving a period, growing breasts, being subjected to male attention at an early age. This trans-exclusionary idea of womanhood leads to an impoverished and incomplete feminism, one that doesn¡¯t just alienate trans people but also leaves out the experiences of many cis women.

>What could better?epitomize the abuse faced by women and girls?than the molestation of more than 150 women in gymnastics by physician Larry Nassar? But young female gymnasts train so hard that their young bodies often?do not develop breasts or periods at the age-appropriate time¡ªare their experiences thus not truly the experiences of women? In fact, there are many conditions that can?result in a woman never having periods. Breasts come in a huge variety of shapes and sizes, and at the end of the day, they¡¯re just a bit of extra tissue¡ªit makes as much sense to say that they¡¯re essential to the experience of womanhood as it would to say that having 10 fingers is essential to the experience of humanity. Many women experience unwanted male attention¡ªbut unless you¡¯re willing to say that a disabled woman who has never been treated as a sexual being because of her disability isn¡¯t a real woman, then this experience can¡¯t be at the heart of what it means to be a woman either.

>In fact, it¡¯s easy to imagine a disabled woman with a condition that affects the development of both primary and secondary sex characteristics who has?none?of the traits that McGowan thinks are essential to womanhood¡ªand who remains, stubbornly, defiantly, a woman.

>Trans men, on the other hand, may have once checked all of McGowan¡¯s boxes and still benefited from male privilege as unambiguously as any cis man. An anecdote that trans neurobiologist Ben Barres?likes to tell?to illustrate this point is that a scientist who was unaware of Barres¡¯ transition once said, ¡°Ben Barres gave a great seminar today, but then his work is much better than his sister¡¯s.¡± Ben Barres was the same person, doing the same work, but maleness gave that work more gravitas, at least to some of his colleagues.

>The point is not that a trans woman¡¯s experience is identical to that of a cis woman but that the experiences of women vary widely, and that feminists who forget this¡ªor undermine it in order to exclude trans women¡ªweaken feminism immeasurably. If watching tampon ads as a girl is central to womanhood (another experience McGowan referenced), then what are we saying about girls who grow up without electricity? If being mistreated by men is at the heart of womanhood, then what room is there to imagine strong girls and women of the future who don¡¯t go through any of that? If women and men are one day truly equal, will there still be men and women? I say yes. Trans-exclusionary feminists aren¡¯t quite as sure.

>Last, but not least, there¡¯s a danger in seeing girlhood as a permanent stain on one¡¯s soul, something that damages a person irrevocably. Set aside the fact that there are such vast differences between cultures that it hardly makes sense to speak of ¡°being raised female¡± as if it were a single thing. It dims the prospects for adult women to see these formative experiences as permanently crippling. If a trans woman who spends 20 years being perceived as a man and 60 years being perceived as a woman can¡¯t be said to have experienced what it¡¯s like to be a woman, then this means that early experiences of sexism are the most important fact of a woman¡¯s life, and they can never be overcome. This fatalism, again, impoverishes feminism. It limits what we can hope for women growing up in an imperfect era and resigns us to a view of women as permanently damaged by childhood experiences of sexism.

Not what I was saying at all. Racism did not just disappear, you are correct. I think the state already did the only thing it can do by passing the Civil Rights Act. Everything else since then that is government sanctioned to promote diversity is counterproductive, however. Whereas you think the State can be used to solve the issue to some extent, I think the State has absolutely no role. Your examples only go to further my argument. That study that employers discriminate against people with minority-sounding names, exists in a society where the government supposedly promotes diversity. 

>Race does still matter. In fact, in your other post you don't look at the governance of this country in terms of what people believe politically, religiously, or culturally. You look at solely in racial terms as if ""mostly white"" means that there a uniform portion of the population that is going to vote exactly the same way.

Not what I meant, you notice in that post I mention the author should use basic statistics. The fact is in a country that is 80% white, the majority of any pool of people, regardless of role, is going to be white. I am criticizing the author for stating the obvious as if it is a bad thing. It's statements like that that only serve to further divide the country.

>Which cannot be done if the Right fundamentally opposes any effort to combat racism as ""white discrimination"".

There is no such thing as ""white discrimination"" or ""reverse discrimination"". Simply put it is discrimination. And some government policies do discriminate against white folks. Those aren't the only policies I am opposed to however. I am opposed to all policy involving race other than the Civil Rights Acts and related Constitutional Amendments. As I said before regardless of the purpose, by making race a factor in order to ""make up"" for past historical events is a fruitless and in this case divisive solution. I maintain the only way to get people to stop looking at color as a factor is to lead by example. The government still promotes racism through its current policies and it is wrong.

>There is something ""special"" about them: they are underrepresented... You cannot blame the government for forcing companies to hire minorities for the lack of minorities that are present in companies

Actually I can. And I will. It's promoting racism in the establishment, maintaining that somehow race is a factor when it comes to employment. The government is sending the message to employers and the people that ""underrepresented minorities"" are somehow inherently inferior to everyone else and need special treatment in order to be competitive. That's not the intention, but that is the underlying psychological message.

Get a little bit of diversity in their countries and things fall apart rapidly. Just look at what happened in Yugoslavia.

How would that function? I run a PUG group and honestly, it just takes too much time to teach people everything they need to know to play 6v6.

There isn't really anything that you need to pick up that you can't learn from the average low level player on a 6s team.

I am claiming to be an atheist, specifically an agnostic atheist. You are free to refute that, or accept it. If you accept it, then I don't see any problem. However, the rest of the three posts that get linked seem to say that's not allowed, because it doesn't match your definition.

Passage in question:

> the obfuscation here is rather transparent: although atheists in online apologetics want us to conflate the idea of lacking belief that God exists with the idea of having a belief that God doesn't exist, by giving us only a single word to refer to both, nearly all of them believe that God doesn't exist, so that tacking on the other meaning to the word they use to describe their believes does absolutely nothing but obscure what it is they believe

You continue this under the heading:

He tried to finish 2 degrees and didn't.

He had no direction whatsoever.

He had no significant accomplishments to my standards.

I indeed look for equals. This is the minimum requirement. Actually, I like to look for partners who are more exceptional than myself.

We met on Tinder.

What you and my partner have in common when I met him and now: a certain spark, an interest, a curiosity about yourself. A desire to better yourself.

I don't see faces. This means I didn't use Tinder in a conventional way. I made a screening algorithm. I used the visual data to determine physical characteristics that are important to me not because of the superficial aspects, but because of what those things can indicate.

My partner had varied pictures, some that were taken by others. Only one of his face up close (which was a relief because I have facial blindness and immediately discounted candidates with more than one up close facial picture), one where he was having fun, one taken by someone else at a moment they seemed to find him ""beautiful"" that was more about taking a picture of his hands (his hands were strong and somehow elegant - my partner is a carpenter who plays piano beautifully).

His profile text was fun. Simple. Still I knew before I met him from this text he felt a certain amount of ""loneliness"". I was curious about the contradiction. 

When we chatted, he was very relaxed. Shy. Modest. When we met I was 10 minutes late because I was so nervous I had to pace for 10 minutes. We played chess. I immediately saw we were not equals in intelligence. However I liked the way his brain ""worked"". He was at an obvious disadvantage having played chess less than myself. Still I could see he had a brain that could visually apply itself in order to better implement aspects of game theory.

We went to my house and my dog liked him. She was always a good judge of character. He judged my dining table construction harshly. I saw he wasn't just a carpenter, he was someone who understood how to build things. How to improve upon things. He played ukele for me. I was right about the hands being elegant, but the way he constructs music was again, very intereresting.

I had flipped one of the digits of his age. He was 26 and not 29. I walked him back to his bicycle and thought we would never see each other again because I thought he wasn't physically attracted to me. 

I don't see faces, but when we were at the cafe, it became apparent that other people found him quite physically attractive and me not as in comparison.

I considered it likely based on this that he would not wish to interact with me again. 

We chatted and I told him we should hang out as friends. He liked me right away, but I can be stupid about picking up cues.

He recently said to me, ""I was good looking enough to attract girls who wanted to sleep with a good looking guy, but once they saw what I had to offer they would leave"".

While I get what your issue is, in this instance Digibro simply didn't put in any effort towards this video or his critique. Besides, just saying ""lol, nothing new was added by the comment"" beleaguers the point. You say videos of varying length are all ""redundant"" to some extent, and - in certain aspects - that's not really wrong.]

Where the fault with your comment lies is that there are videos out there that aren't redundant or bring to light new aspects that - while of course they become obvious after you've seen them - most people simply wouldn't have thought of. Supereyepatchwolf, for one, is a great anituber in this regard. Bestguyever is also one of the best in bringing to light aspects of anime or issues that no one else ever brings up. Cartoon Cypher is another fantastic one. You just have to branch out to the minor leagues instead of solely relying on the big names, as of course those names are going to simply repeat the same shit over and over again.

While other anitubers like The Anime Man, Mother's Basement, or Glass Reflection have their niches and also can be redundant, the worst offender of all of this is Digibro for a few fairly simple reasons: Digibro is jaded and cynical. 

He's not an analytical anituber - he's a reactionary. Everything that he puts out is stamped with his stereotypical angst and because of that he, more often than not, doesn't ever add anything new to the conversation. It's actually one of the biggest reasons I can't stand his videos; he has almost no positive commentary and instead jumps to conclusions without giving thought beyond what he sees (which usually means he never gets past the first episode, or maybe the third). He's become so nihilistic regarding anime, that everything he says is just that: crude and worthless. For chrissakes, he did those entire 20 some odd ""Why The Asterisk War Sucks"" videos without actually understanding what he's talking about. Granted, while I'm not a huge fan of The Asterisk War, the mere fact he went that in depth as to why he hates it is beyond enough to understand his motivations - not to mention his ridiculous ""How To Tell An Anime Sucks From One Episode"" video.

That's just the kind of person he is: angry, jaded and has the desire to spread that hate to everyone so they can also hate the things he hates. Go through his videos and look to see what he actually likes. There's literally maybe five videos talking about something he enjoyed, and his KonoSuba video is about as close to a positive perspective as you're going to get from him.

You say it's to present the ideas in a simple and interesting way. In the case of Digibro, that's simply not the case. He's not providing any interesting content, he's simply being redundant about the same issues he's had from the very beginning. If people find that to be enlightening, so be it. But, in my opinion, his commentary is about as far away from legitimate critique and being interesting than any other anituber. And that's saying a lot.

Digibro is just not someone you want to have dictate new ideas and positions, because 9 times out of 10 those positions are ""This sucks and if you like it, you suck"". That very attitude has become systemic and is influencing a great many anime fans as he happens to be one of the most popular, if not the most popular commentator. To say that he's providing a novel approach and that's ultimately the point of watching his shows is just a great disservice to the anime fandom on the whole.

The internet is not an accurate representation of how people operate offline.

"You might want to get a cup of tea or something because this is going to take a while to explain all of your logical errors and misunderstandings though I hope we come out of this ahead.

Yes most aspects of agriculture won't directly involve you just as most activities on the planet are ""things other people did"". It's a logical error to assert actions of others don't impact you as indirect impacts can be of the very same severity as direct ones. The impact of ""other people"" not growing enough food in our society is exactly the same as if you didn't grow/hunt enough yourself in a subsistence society. The only reason you or anybody else for that matter is alive is because of things other people did. The people who invented crop rotation, the people who figured out through the study of evolution that genetic diversity is critical to reducing famine, if these things didn't happen there is a good chance you wouldn't be here (probably the largest impact of all).

Now for your analogy - accounting does have an incredible impact on your life, once again you're assuming something doesn't simply because you know nothing of it, a case of prideful ignorance if ever I saw. Apart from the fact that even medium sized businesses couldn't function without accounting you also have the direct impacts associated with accounting gone bad, for example the Enron accounting scandal which wiped $2 billion from the pensions of their 20,000 employees was a pretty direct impact for them. And yes, as a society we do require the teaching of mathematics which is a fundamental requirement for accounting, just as evolution is a fundamental requirement for biology. 

Also yes we would prevent the teaching of non-mathematical based systems of accounting because just like with evolution there is no alternate theory of accounting. We would never take seriously a superstitious approach to accounting such as throwing goat bones and interpreting from how they land the value of our liquid assets.

Another massive logical fault in your argument is that of knowing about something being equal to impact_. You said ""the average person need know nothing about anyone else's trade"" and that somehow that denotes a lack of impact. You don't know how to run a power plant I assume but you'd certainly see the impact of a power outage just as nobody cares if what you think about the impact of evolution but you'd feel the impact pretty quickly if you didn't have food or medicine. 

For the last point I think it's extremely clear that the opinions of unqualified people do not matter - I don't ask my plumber for a medical assessment and physicists won't take a democratic vote to determine the value of 'c'. In fact in almost any profession you care to check (except politics) systems are devised to keep ridiculous and uninformed ideas from muddying the pool. This is precisely where the term experts comes into play.

If you aren't aware how evolution impacts the world, or how accounting has contributed to the large scale growth of societies, then why would your opinion on any of these topics be worth anything at all, the supreme arrogance here is in your hubris that you should be listened to even when speaking from a megaphone of unqualified ignorance.

That and because he was painting me as a criminal for carrying the knife and pepper spray is why I gave him his attitude right back. That isn't a crime and frankly, I'm a reasonable guy. If he had been reasonable with me, there wouldn't have been a problem.

If you know you've done nothing wrong then there's zero reason for you to become confrontational back. In fact, it's in your best interest to start recording any adverse police behavior and remain calm and polite throughout the entire interaction... especially if you want people to be on your side of the argument.

All I can see is what I see in the video, which stars off with the officer asking a simple question in what sounds like a reasonably polite tone and you responding with anger and defensive statements. Maybe he was a dick from the get-go maybe he wasn't... It's not illegal to be a dick to a cop, but it's certainly stupid.

> I'm sorry, but ordering someone to get off their bike without clear cause, forcibly remove them when they ask why, remove legal weapons from them without cause

The police are legally permitted to do all of those things for their own safety, and it's up to their discretion. Did they give you your weapons back at the end of the stop? If so, they've done nothing wrong here. They're allowed to ask someone with a CCW to step away from their firearm for the duration of a traffic stop as well. They can take it, or ask you to step out of your vehicle. This is all legal and permissible and for the officer's safety.

I can't possibly know if you're telling the truth here or not. If he was a dick from the get-go then obviously he was in the wrong. File a complaint with the department and show them your video of his 'misconduct' if you want.

So what you're saying is, if you're getting less short-term income than you used to, you should increase your long-term expenses in order to artificially return your short-term income to the place where it was? You can't see how that method only pushes the problem into the future?

Say you manage to get your tax revenues back to where they were after a while. OK, the downside is that now you have higher interest rates than before, because your loans are bigger, so the net gain is still less than it was. Here you might argue that your ""activating the economy"" has had positive effects on growth, so that the tax revenues actually are higher than before, evening everything out.

So what you've done here, in the best case scenario, is you've managed to maintain the status quo, but with the consequence of having higher debt than before, that is dependent on a yearly growth rate equal to or higher than the yearly interest rate (or you'd be forced to take even more new loans to maintain the economy). The next time a crisis hits, you'll be in the exact situation as you were before, only now with even more debt.

No doubt, countless Pulgars have probably come and gone without ever playing the game. For that reason I say society are the ones that need to catch up. I'll leave it at that.

As to the Elo question, you're simply not understanding the concept, which is kind of funny because it's the part of what I said that helps your original argument. 

You use the rating range of ""1400-1700"" for your example. This shows right there an inherent lack of understanding of the concept to begin with. For one, there's nothing inherently true about Elo rating where you can say ""let's say their true rating is X"". It's only a rating relative to the pool it's played in. So to say ""let's assume they're rated 1400-1700"" is an unreasonable assumption. For one it gives credence to the idea that there's some sort universally true rating that you can assign to each player, which there isn't. Secondly, why would the range be so tight? In reality, they'd have terrible players in this pool as well. So if you were to give them each a FIDE rating equivalent, a more fair assumption would be something like 600-2600.

On an island where there's no 2700 fide players, we'd get one of them reaching 2700 anyways. It doesn't matter what their fide rating would be, the cream would still rise to the top. ",1

"> Just straight up vigilantism because someone CALLED this person a nazi or whatever. Not because they ARE a nazi, but because they were CALLED one.

I mean, I think vigilantism is wrong even if they're a nazi. Mob justice isn't real justice. I also hold very idealistic (possibly naive) views on punishment - I think that retribution should not factor into punishment at all, neither should deterrent (since that's not something that is actually going to help anyone after the crime is committed - it's just that at that point, you have to go through with the threat... but also because apparently deterrent doesn't mean anything to most people anyway). So I only really think that punishment should be for rehabilitation, and if there's no possibility of reform then they should be locked up, but only for safety, not for punishment. I think this should apply to anyone, even Hitler himself if he were still alive today. I've not had any of my relatives murdered though so I suppose it's easy for me to say that forgiveness is better than spite. 

But at the very least, I think that everyone should face the official justice system of their country. If someone (not a legal executioner, or soldier) kills a supposed Nazi or terrorist, then they are just as much a murderer whether or not the victim was innocent.

> It's pretty fucking disturbing.

Yeah, especially the dehumanisation. It's so blindly hypocritical, too! People saying ""terrorists are not humans"" forget that the reason that the terrorists can justify killing innocent civilians might be because they don't see us as human. Instead of trying to look for a solution, they just opt to continue the cycle of prejudice and hatred without thinking about what they're doing.

> even though I basically want to disagree with this, this is the most reasonable argument I've ever heard about not using that term, 

Thanks very much for considering what I was saying! And yeah, I'm not defending the people that actually do fit the label of SJW, but even then, if anything is going to change their minds, it's persuasion rather than outright hostility. So, if there is someone specific that you strongly disagree with, it's still better to approach them with the expectation that there's a chance they will listen to what you will say, even if that chance seems very small. 

Either that or give up on trying to change people's minds completely, and just ignore them - but arguing based on assumptions that you've made about them, or trying to force them to change their mind by berating them is just a waste of time and emotional effort. The only way I can see that strategy ever working is if you can make it so uncomfortable for them to keep believing in their own beliefs that they are forced to accept your own ideas... but... that tactic makes me feel very uneasy, since you'd basically be thought police at that point.

> I'm talking about not having to think about what I say for fear of offending someone. This is a direct infringement on my freedom of speech, is it not?

There are two subtly different, but connected parts to this and I'm not sure, which one you are asking. One is the ""I don't want to offend someone, so I don't say what I'm thinking"" part. That clearly doesn't violate any of your rights, because it's fundamentally your choice. You are free to say what you want, you just don't. The other is the ""I am forbidden to say things that I want to say"" part. And that also doesn't violate your rights, because xkcd. You can say whatever you want, but you have to accept the consequences, that people might not like you afterwards and choose not to work with you anymore. That's a fundamental property of human nature. It is our right as a community to chose who can participate in it and profit from it and if we choose to only interact with people who we don't consider assholes, then you will just have to live outside of our community or choose not to be an asshole (I use ""asshole"" in a liberal interpretation here for simplification. Please note that there are nuances both to ""levels of assholenes"" and ""levels of exclusion from the community"").

I strongly suggest you come up with a better term instead of ""free speech"". I can accept that it is convenient and useful for your cause (because it is emotionally laden and a strong buzzword in the internet culture, because it is so much influenced by US culture). But it is also already reserved for scenarios that have the specific power imbalance between governments and their people.

> I simply cannot comprehend how I can be involved in a discussion, then you say that you find what I said offensive and expect me to apologise? This concept literally does not make sense to me. You are in fact saying that I have committed a wrong act by speaking openly about a topic.

"The type of thinking you're advocating creates the perfect shield for so-called skeptics, protecting them from ever having to address any possible new empirical observations. Especially when the topic has elements of strangeness, taboo, and fear. And that is exactly why those skeptics continually fall back on it, ""it"" being the type of sloppy thinking you'll find over at BadUFOs. Because they don't have to do any real work, and don't have to leave their intellectual comfort zones.

The sloppy thinking over there is often something like this:

1) Start with the assumption that alien-based UFOs can't get to Earth from other star systems.

2) Sprinkle on a little of ""if aliens could get here, it would be so rare as to be a probability of basically zero. [Insert meaningless Drake Equation calculation based on more assumptions.]¡±

3) Now that they've improperly set the rules, the ""skeptics"" over there can (as you're trying to do here with Bayes' Theorem) eliminate the strangest elements of any strong UFO case by simply appealing to probability -- ""overall it's much more likely that the object was an aircraft, and we've found some hugely improbable yet mundane event that could almost semi-plausibly explain that element of this UFO case. And therefore (because UFOs are improbable, remember?), all this other evidence can be dismissed, too. So, in conclusion, the UFO in this case must have just been an aircraft."" Tada! Case solved! (And note that the people over there 100% do consider themselves to have solved the RB-47 case. Amazing....)

4) And now we get to the part some self-labeled skeptics love the most: sit and wait, while impatiently drumming their fingers, for the UFOlogists -- UFOlogists who are almost entirely part-time and amateurish, necessarily -- to provide the skeptics with the ""extraordinary evidence"" that would be needed in order to prove that true UFOs are real.

There is a contraceptive advert ""sin twice: use a condom"". This works because the Church says a condom is never licit. By allowing it in licit sex, you'd be hard pressed to convince anyone that it is explicitly not allowed in illicit sex.

">You keep presenting faulty analogies. 

You claim that it is faulty without anything to back it up. Rights are cultural institutions, like marriages and money.

>What I asked was, if we grant that a right had been proved, what would be the consequence?

This question is nonsensical. Rights aren't theorems. They aren't proved. They are declared, recognized, granted, asserted, etc.

>No, I asserted that, applying the standards you set (i.e., ""we can make anything a right""), we would logically deduce that nothing is a right.

And it does not follow. Just like 'we can marry any two people, therefore no one is married' or 'we can make anything currency (paper, coins, bitcoins), therefore nothing is currency.' Please actually do logically deduce it, and I'll concede the point. Until then it's empty rhetoric to say that you could do it. I'll repeat myself: no matter how much you need to misread me, I don't endorse moral relativism.

>By asserting that ""we can make anything a right,"" you denied both the absolute existence of rights and the objective existence of rights.

No, for the same reason that married people and currency exist objectively. Unless you have a weird definition of what exists.

>Again, neither moral realism nor consequentialism would permit that ""we can make anything a right.""

A consequentialist, say an utilitarian, could, to make it simple, just say that the only moral fact is that one should maximize utility, while still holding that rights (like currency and marriages) are human institutions, albeit ones that tend to maximize utility in most (but not all) circumstances. That is a perfectly coherent stance.

>If moral facts exist, then it cannot possibly be true that ""we can make anything a right."" 

Give a non question-begging reason why. 

Before you try, get this through your thick head: rights and moral facts are not mutually entailing concepts. If you think they are mutually entailing, that is a substantive thesis, not a conceptual one, thus you have to argue for it.

>The existence of moral facts is, however, the very basis of natural rights theory.

Sure, but natural rights theory is far from being entailed by moral realism, which I fucking endorse.

>You expressly claimed that ""we can make anything a right."" This is the very essence of relativism.

You shoud produce an argument for this claim instead of merely repeating it.

>>No. That doesn't follow. All it would show is that natural selection has resulted in certain individuals expressing approval or disapproval of certain behavior. You can't jump from this to a metaphysical thesis.

>Not only does it follow--it's the same statement reiterated. A general biological predisposition to approve and disapprove of certain behavior is an innate moral impulse.

Nope, and I'm not surprised you don't see the distinction. Approval and disapproval are public, observable behavior. A moral impulse is an unobservable, para-mechanical explanation of that behavior. There is no reason to jump from one to the other, which is my point. Also, I didn't say individuals were pre-disposed, but that the behavior would be the result of natural selection. Different claims.

Anyway I reject the premise which states that approval and disapproval, which are learned social practices, are biologically determined.

>If you would really like to know, then I suggest you do some research on this topic. The relation between our chemical and biological matter and our moral impulses is a pretty ""hot"" issue at the moment, across several academic disciplines. However, it's usually the extent and nature of this relationship that I've seen debated, rather than the existence of the relationship, which is so self-evident that it seems presumed. By the way, philosophically, this fits under the banner of materialism. Maybe you skipped that wikipedia article?

Empty rhetoric. Stop bullshitting. Things that are so self-evident as to be presumed are called prejudice or dogma. But far from being self-evident, the idea that normativity reduces to biology is highly contested. I'm a philosophy grad student, I don't need wikipedia, and materialism is utterly irrelevant to this discussion.

>Anyway, some simple observational evidence 

is insufficient to assert metaphysical theses like moral realism. Are you even trying?

>of a material basis for morality includes (i) the cross-cultural commonality of various moral precepts 

Cool. 'All cultures agree that X is wrong, therefore X is wrong as a matter of fact' is a non-sequitur. Ad populum. Also has nothing to do with a 'material basis.'

>and (ii) brain pathology exhibited in many who commit ""immoral"" acts, as compared to brains of morally ""normal"" people.

This is so weak. The scare quotes just show how weak even you believe it is. Is correlation causation now? What about immoral behavior of people with healthy brains? Couldn't this also be explained by the fact that we have a tendency to marginalize (i.e. express disapproval of) people with certain pathologies? And again, this is nothing to show the existence of moral facts, because that would require that expressions of approval or disapproval be correct or incorrect, have truth-value. This is something which no amount of biology could ever prove.

>But we do not need to locate a ""moral gene"" to determine that there is a genetic (i.e., bio-chemical and heritable) basis for morality.

Genetic doesn't mean 'bio-chemical and heritable', it means 'pertaining to genes'. Stop moving the goalposts to wiggle out of your bullshit claims.

"herein lies the issue.. cat is 30 feet up. Generally speaking, extension ladders carried by many FD's are less than 30 feet. Some departments carry laders that are 30+ but they are unwieldy and need several people to set up and use safely (5 people). 

Also, a ladder truck with one of their ladders in use is (at least where I served) is considered ""out of service"" until said ladder can be taken down and secured back on the truck.

So if they use a portable 30+ ladder, the truck is out of service until the cat recovery is completed or the big ladder can be taken down and secured. 99.99% of the time, that won't be an issue. but that .001% where a crew was late responding to an active job due to the cat could possibly delay a rescue operation, and in a worst case scenario, a human fatality. 

In that unlikely, but ever present case, the FD would be crucified publicly.

""but what about a ladder truck that has a large ladder mounted on the top of a truck that can be controlled by hydraulics by one guy? Why not use that instead of the 5 man, 30+ foot portable?""

Glad you asked. As a safety measure, ladder trucks cannot deploy a mounted ladder without first jacking the truck up on hydraulic stabilizers. The ladder controls will not function until 4 (generally), independently controlled jacks are set and the sensors on the truck tell the computer that deployment of the ladder is safe. 

To be frank, it takes some time to deploy (and subsequently retract) any fixed ladder system, once again, putting the ladder truck ""out of service"" for those critical few minutes in that 99.99% chance that something goes very wrong for someone else (IE: their house is on fire).

Now, when you made contact with the FD and they were eating dinner, yes at that moment they were probably relaxing and having some tasty grub. And there is a very good chance that in the time they were eating said very good grub, nothing that was critical would happen....

BUT if they stopped eating, put the ladder truck out of commission and went to help your cat, and a true emergency happened, they'd be caught with their pants down and open to a number of lawsuits that could in fact bankrupt the department/county/city etc.

Could the guys have done the job? Sure. Would they do it? probably... but like any other job in the world, they gotta cover their own ass first. Given the volatile nature and potential implications of working in any of the emergency services (FD, PD, EMS, Hospitals etc etc) I would expect them to act just as you described.

I assure you, it was not a personal assault against you or your cat (who I imagine you are quite fond of) but they need to protect themselves while working in a field that is very prone to wrongful death/injury lawsuits

> Occupy and Tea Party are 2 different animals, as only one has become an actual political force in washington.

Whether or not the Tea Party can be argued to be more or less successful than the Occupy Wallstreet crowd is immaterial, the fact remains that in season two Occupy Wallstreet will be the focus simply because it's what happened.

>[T]hese stories allow the humans in this world to discuss things around the story, and yet when they do, no one stands up and has a real debate about anything. It's just people expressing their outrage or opinions on something and everyone nodding their heads.

I disagree. Do I wish there was more exposition on how exactly Will McAvoy is a conservative and how he champions those conservative solutions to issues he covers on the news? Absolutely! I think it's important to consider though that at this point in the series (only up to episode six for me) McAvoy is still somewhat reeling from feeling that his party has been taken over and so his focus has been on that and his television career and so we don't see much political conservatism from him in his ""off camera"" time.

I'm really expecting that to change in season two or I'll be very disappointed.

>There is nothing in this show to invite conservative people I know into the discussion. They are all told that they are part of the idiot party, and that they can't really argue against that because one of their own told them so.

Huh? No way! That's not the message I'm seeing at all!

The message I'm seeing is that the conservatives are being told their party has been invaded and hijacked, just like in the 60's the Democrats suffered something like that. I'm seeing a heroic attempt to shift public opinion by telling people the facts and showing them just how they're being treated like mushrooms.

Once season two kicks off I'd imagine we're going to see Will McAvoy cracking jokes to those who gave him a hard time about his sudden liberalism and asking them how they feel about the Occupy Wallstreet crowd. I expect to see his conservatism highlighted more then against the backdrop of the more radical and liberalized Occupy Movement.

As far as the caloric intake argument goes, that is not true.

The idea is based on the law of thermodynamics. Total Change in Energy=Energy in - Energy out.

The idea is that The lower the change in energy number, the more likely you are to lose weight. So the variable that's easiest to manipulate is Energy in, by eating less.

Turns out, not the case with animals or humans. If energy in lowers, energy out will lower as the body tries to keep the total change in energy the same. The calorie argument is false and has been proven false since the 70s, but dietitians want to sell their patented diet plans and have pushed for this Change in Energy=Energy in - Energy out to be undeniable truth, it couldn't be further from the truth.

Now I will concede that if you eat horribly shitty foods, but exercise like Michael Phelps, you will probably not be fat, but most people don't have the time or discipline to do such a thing.

Universities will endlessly raise tuition due to the guaranteed subsidies, making the price of schooling far exceed the free market value. Since the price of schooling will be tied to the student's future income, and not the actual price of the service, if there is a disparity in this cost(We know due to past experience that tuition rates will rise far above inflation rates), the tax payer will be forced to pay it.

This is a start of the program and it can be amended to fix such problems. The State can and will step in to continue to allow our great citizens the freedom of affordable higher learning.

>This ""gamble"" you speak of is simply unjust. It is against all free market and liberty oriented principles for the government to set up a system where the same good or service can have a wildly different cost based on the income of individuals.

I would use this program if I could and I'm sure the vast majority of people would too. If this program helps me be very successful then I'm okay with paying whatever I have to. Those with family incomes over 250k can't even sign up for the program.

If I end up paying 2% on 50k income I think I got a good deal on college and I'm happy. If I end up paying 2% on 50 million I'll thank the state for giving me the chance to be very successful and be happy knowing I'm helping fund others higher education.

No, it doesn't. No one who has ever taken statistics would be under the impression that any given statistic constitutes a claim that only the variable the statistic refers to is causally relevant.

Yes, generalizing statistics, a statement about group behaviors and tendencies, to make assumptions about a specific individual is fallacious.

> Likewise, to assume that any relatively small group of males contains a rapist is sexist.

And here it falls apart yet again. No. Statistics are statements about groups. The previous example was correct because you were taking a group tool and applying it to a specific individual. However, you then tried to use that trivial observation to make the jump that a group tool cannot validly be applied to groups, an absolutely ridiculous notion that again displays that you don't really have any background with statistics. I don't mean that as an offense either, but understanding the topic does actually matter if you're gonna try to go around making claims about it.

"> You have to remember that to just get 1 more pound into space, you have to add more fuel. Then, you have to add more fuel to make up for that weight of the fuel, and you keep going until it equalizes. This is the key, you can't do this forever, at some point, at some gravity level, i'm sure before 125% more gravity, at our current ability to generate thrust from fuel, we will be unable to make space.

That's not how rockets work. A rocket is a giant, hollow tube where over 90% of the mass is the fuel weight. The volume of fuel scales faster than the volume of the container necessary to hold the fuel, so where a rocket that is the size of your arm may only be 50% fuel, a rocket that is the size of the empire state building is going to be well over 90%, and so on. 

As a result, you are postulating a gravitational world in which exploding fuel is not enough to propel its own mass upward - you are going to have to need much stronger gravity than 2.125X in order to achieve this. 

Is there a limit to how strong gravity can be and there still be an achievable escape velocity? Yes, for once, it's called a black hole. That has an escape velocity well over the speed of light. Similarly, I'm sure there is an escape velocity that would be unachievable through normal chemical combustion, but its a hell of a lot more than 2.25x earth gravity.

That's the core of why I'd argue we shouldn't say pantheism is guilty of equivocation or else we'd have to levy the same charge against all forms theism. There simply exists no objective base to build a definition of god on. The definition of god must be included in a premise. It can't be assumed.

However, there's a difference between personal bias that constructs an answer to questions out of fantasy and a personal bias that attempts to conflate that answer with a concrete concept we already have.

""What is God?""

""We don't know. Therefore God is my sock. All hail the Sock God!""

That's equivocation. In order to resolve the problem of not having a coherent definition for a god, we attempt to tie it to something unrelated that does have a coherent definition.

> But I would argue religions like Judaism and deism/classical theism are the most coherent forms of theism (not necessarily true, but far more coherent than asking a random stranger off the street to define god). Why should we count out the most coherent simply because it's not the most popular? Isn't that an appeal to popularity?

What is language but an appeal to popularity? We use words to attempt to convey ideas. The more concrete the idea the more precise our language tends to become. Judaism and other classical forms of theism posit concrete ideas of gods and mysticism, but are hindered by reality's refusal to provide demonstrable support for those ideas. So the language gets confused as we try to discuss something that we have no common experience over and variations in ideas spring up everywhere.

Pantheism is different in that it attempts to resolve this confusion by replacing ""god"" with ""universe"" even though the concept of ""universe"" is already sufficiently concrete that it doesn't need it and the addition only serves to confuse both.

> Quick side note, but this isn't true. :) The Bohr-Einstein debates are excellent examples of some of the quite emotionally strong disagreements which can ultimately be considered definitional and of a descriptive nature of reality. The very need and subsequent disagreement of QM interpretations is another great example. M-theory with its mind boggling S/T-duality and associated physical implications are a third.

As I said before, those are details. ;) The foundational concept is concrete is non-controversial; it's only when we start exploring how and why things are the way they are that we start seeing emotional investment.

I don't think they need the guidance of a cop or drill sergeant (although some appear that way), but they definitely do seem to be clueless about morality once you reject their bases of it in the constitution and religion. Which is why so many conservative christians think atheists are totally amoral sociopaths, and why so many conservatives in politics think anything that isn't in line with what the founding fathers wanted is bad.

I think it's possible to grow out of such mindsets, and therefore think that the naturally submissive part is slightly inaccurate, as an ex conservative it's more of a lifelong conditioning thing. ",1

"> Having more options does not necessarily increase depth in a multiplayer game, which is what Sirlin focuses on.

As I already said, I think that Sirlin's insights are generally applicable. More options does not necessarily increase depth in a single-player game, either. Sid Meier describes a game as a set of interesting decisions; if those decisions favor some options over others, then they become less interesting. 

> With that in mind, having more options is rarely a bad thing, because they afford the player more flexibility in how he wants to play the game.

That's abdicating responsibility. Yes, the player can choose between different options; but it's the responsibility of the developer to make sure that the choice between those options is interesting and fun. The choice to Pair Up or not to Pair Up is uninteresting in Awakening; it is interesting in Fates. I would argue that therefore, Awakening would be better off without Pair Up.

Everyone in the restaurant can hear it and everything just stops. As she's becoming more and more volatile, he's trying to calm her down. I'm not sure what to do at this point.

I don't understand how your mother not carrying at her job with kids means other people can't do so comfortably. 

>If she wore her holster around children, she'd spend all day trying to keep her bra from being ripped off by curious kids trying to find out what she's got, because hey, it could be candy!!

That has to be the dumbest thing I have ever heard. She can't carry because a kid might see it and think its candy? The 'Flash Bang' type holster goes on the underside of the bra and rides center line at the bottom of the rib cage. You can't see it and a kid would have to get their hand all the way up or down your blouse to access the gun. No, that is a weak and stupid reason.

>There are also other times when it is impractical for her to wear a holster.

Okay? Totally irrelevant. We're talking about teachers carrying at work, you wearing many formal gowns to first grade? Not being able to carry in a full length gown is a stupid and entirely narrow situation that plenty of women have managed to figure out in the past.

African share of population greatly exceeds whatever historical they ever reached, so I don¡ät understand this argument, the European growth in the 19th century is already on a smaller scale than this one.

>Hence why I said most, which is true. Some countries in Africa are already below replacement and Sub-Sahara Africa has seen its TFR fall steadily since the 1980s.

>If you're so concerned with population growth why don't we stop handing out child benefits to post the fertility in Europe? 

Like they even work, or like European stagnant decline is the reason of the overall growth. You see population decline (I guess only if too fast) in Europe has economic effect on pensions and such, too large population growth in Africa has only negative effects for them specifically.

Wow Tunisia and South Africa, they are only but a tiny portion of Africa, and the later even is not yet at replacement level, despite supposedly being a exception. So no most African (specifically Sub Saharan) country have had only a slow decline in their fertility rates in the last decades.

"Do you have to ask the McDonald's employee how much an ice cream cone costs to decide whether or not to buy it? Do you compare the price of different gums to decide which gum to buy? You can make the assumption that it's priced low enough that people will buy it, so you look for what you want without really considering price too much. You don't need to ask the price because you are certain you can afford it, and it's the flavor you want, even if the gum you want is 2-3x the price of the other gums available. If the price of an ice cream cone or gum is a significant factor in deciding whether or not you will buy it, you are probably better off just not buying it.

You are seriously overestimating how much $40k is to a big business. I see 2-3 million if dollars worth of product move through my department at work every day, $40k is barely a blip on the radar. We're not even the biggest department in the building, there's $15-20 million dollars worth of product that leaves our factory every day. If the company I work for were to buy a 3D printer they would look for the printer that best fits their needs and as long as it isn't drastically overpriced (which is extremely rare because the other company needs to sell the a bunch of that product to stay afloat, so it is almost guaranteed to be reasonably priced) that would be the one they would buy. 

Price is only one factor when buying something, it's importance varies drastically for each purchase. For things that are going to be purchased in very large quantities (a component that goes into a product) the price is really important because a 1 cent price difference means several million dollars per year. But for something like a big ass 3D printer that's likely going last several years and pay for itself in that time, cost is a much smaller part of the equation. Things like features, quality, reliability, serviceability matter a lot more.

"I see you added on to your message, and it¡¯s the usual flaccid ¡°YKIIARR¡± claptrap.

It is a trope among people who loathe and fear Islam that their fear and loathing has nothing in common with racism because Islam is not a race, the implication being that hating Muslims is rational and wise whereas hating black people is deeply irrational and stupid.

> Some people who claim that Islam is profoundly evil will also say that they bear Muslims no ill will but I don¡¯t think they are telling the truth. It is really difficult and indeed psychologically unnatural to claim that you hate an ideology without hating the people in whose lives it is expressed. Religions, nations, and even races are all shared imaginative constructs (although nations and races have other characteristics as well) and if you really want to extirpate them, you must extirpate the people who imagine them as well.

> The claim that Islam isn¡¯t a race and so it is entirely rational to hate and fear it gains its moral force from the implicit claim that there is something uniquely horrible about racial hatred.

A common defense used by those making prejudice statements regarding Muslims has been to claim that 'Islam is not a race', this doesn't fly with comedian Ben McLeay who says that, besides it being weird that they think that their 'mis-categorisation' is a defense excusing their bigotry, it actually doesn't make them any less racist.

> If I had a dollar for everyone someone has told me ¡°Islam isn¡¯t a race¡± in the last week, I probably wouldn¡¯t currently be two months behind on my internet bill. Delivered every single time by someone confident that they¡¯re the first person to ever say it to me, it¡¯s a sentence invariably used to argue that someone¡¯s anti-Muslim sentiment isn¡¯t the product of racism, and therefore totally fine.

> The worst people alive are crawling out of the woodwork to comment exactly this sentence on every single article about Sonia Kruger and Pauline Hanson they can find, hoping that people will stop mistaking their hate speech for dangerous racism and instead acknowledge it as run-of-the-mill, harmless religious discrimination.

> Islam is estimated to constitute a full 45% of the population of Africa, and our dear friends to the north, Indonesia, have the largest Muslim population of any country in the world. As you can see, Islam is an incredibly diverse religion.

> ¡°Ah, you¡¯ve made my point! You¡¯ve been defeated by your own logic!¡± I hear you type angrily into the comments section. Well, no actually, I¡¯ve made mine. What does ISIS ( the Islamic State Of Iraq and Syria) have to do with a schoolteacher in Indonesia? Absolutely nothing.

> This is what we call ¡°coded¡± racism. Using a term that doesn¡¯t quuuiiiiite get at the meat of the fucked thing you¡¯re really saying. In a time when we were getting better at not being dicks about gay people, dickheads were making fun of people for being ¡°metrosexual¡± as a neat way of not making fun of them for 'dressing like a poof'. In the US, the term ¡°thug¡± is used a lot by conservative talking heads as a way of vilifying young black men.

> These people might be saying that it¡¯s Muslims they want to stop from immigrating to Australia, but they¡¯re not talking about the schoolteacher from Indonesia or the doctor from Uzbekistan, they are talking about people that, let¡¯s not mince words here, look like Osama bin Laden.

> If somehow everything went to shit and these complete winguses got into power, they wouldn¡¯t be searching white people at the airport to see if they¡¯re carrying a Quran, they wouldn¡¯t be measuring the beards of visiting Swedes, they would be stopping everyone of Middle Eastern appearance they saw.

While ignoring the following questions because they force to you admit something you probably don't want to admit - either you apparently don't care about crime (you only care about guns, which is why you fixate explicitly on gun crimes), or you apparently believe that crimes committed with guns are worse than crimes committed by other means.

I also like how you wholly ignore defensive gun use.
>Wow. Absolutely everything can contribute to lowering gun violence. Except gun control. Because reasons. /s

It's more that, there are more factors at work in violence and we have PROVEN CAUSALITY for some factors while guns->violent crimes isn't even correlated, much less proven - so why the fuck are you wasting political capital and effort targeting the method, which IS NOT A CONFIRMED CAUSAL FACTOR instead of the proven causes of these crimes?

If you ban some of the guns (because a total ban is explicitly unconstitutional and will not pass unless you manage to repeal the Second Amendment first), you MIGHT see a reduction in total violent crimes. Emphasis on might. You will probably see a reduction in gun crimes, but that DOES NOT mean that will translate to a reduction in total violent crimes and there is very little solid data to support such a claim.

On the other hand, if you introduce legislation to target ANY of those non-gun factors I mentioned above, you WILL see a reduction in total violent crime rates - WHICH INCLUDES GUN CRIMES - because they are a causal factor in violent crime rates.

Political capital and willpower is not infinite in a democracy. You cannot both ban the guns and tackle our fucked up private prison system and implement universal healthcare in whatever form and tackle income inequality and begin taking steps to end the war on drugs and make our public schools less shit and beat seven kinds of hell out of predatory student loan lenders so that people can actually afford to pursue post-secondary education without turning themselves into wage slaves for 20 years thereafter.

We have irrefutable proof of the political cost of pursuing policies like gun bans in this country AND we have peer-reviewed and verified data of the inefficacy of those bans. And yet you STILL persist in trying to push these bans instead of ANYTHING ELSE that would be GUARANTEED to not only affect our violent crime rates (which includes gun crimes!) but also have positive effects elsewhere in our country?

This is why no one outside of your fucking echo chamber, no one that has given five fucking minutes of actual thought and research into this issue, takes you people seriously. You either don't want to fix the problem and just want to feel superior to people you view as backwards and uneducated... or you do want to fix the problem but are too busy being gaslit by your media outlets to bother thinking for yourselves.

"TIL that reddit doesn't know that Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism are not religions. They are ethical systems of conduct, not worship.

If anything, each one is more of a psychology on how to live a balanced life than a religion. 

Religion is defined as: the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, esp. a personal God or gods.

How do any of the aforementioned philosophies fit that definition? 

The Tao is not a force to worship, but a force to understand. It's something to be aware of and recognize in order to help you live a better life.

Same with Buddhism. The major tenants of it propose that people recognize their suffering and what causes it--usually, some sort of attachment to objects, feelings, etc.

Confucianism is nothing more than Aesop's tales in an Asian style. 

Again, all of these are ideologies of living a good life. Which, imo, has nothing to do with religion because it's not dependent on anything outside of one's self. 

Think of them as Socrates. Wise words to live by regardless of the origin or source.

Whether or not it has the ascribed status of a theory or a matter of faith, it still represents a matter of some faith if you express belief in it. Within the lab, it is just an unproven theory-- in pop culture, it can be something larger. 

>You seem to know a lot about the intents and motivations of people you don't even know.

People aren't as individualistic and unique as they pretend to be. When you have a widespread interfaith phenomena like evangelism, it's more likely to represent a common aspect of the human psyche than being a coincidental shared personal quest. 

>Do tell. What is the ""dogma"" of atheists? Is it documented somwhere? Is there some definitive guide?

There are shades of centrality in atheism, much of it centered around the writings of Darwin, Sagan, and Dawkins. Dawkins is probably the closest thing popular atheist culture has to a pope. His writings are squarely evangelical. 

>You have yet to establish the ""religion"" of atheists.

In most cases, they probably subscribe to a dogmatically materialist view of reality-- that all things that are real must be personally apparent and manifest physically. Although modern scientific culture (real science has no certainty) lauds this belief as the most plausible, it's still quite dogmatic and requires a degree of faith in the secular foundations of academia. 

>So far it has something to do with evangelizing even though it should be clear by now that evangelizism is not a primary component of religion nor is it even a good indicator. I can name a dozen things off hand that people evangelize, but wouldn't even come close to being religious in nature.

If people are ""evangelizing"" something, then they are employed in a religious behavior, even if they're talking about something consumer-oriented-- like Apple products. If they're evangelizing a higher truth or reality that is outside human understanding (like whether or not there is a higher power), then it's distinctly religious evangelism. If atheism was merely a function of doubt, then there would be no evangelism. It wouldn't even operate as a group or subculture. 

>Maybe it would. So what? If they don't believe in deities or spirits and don't perform rituals in an organized manner, I have no problem excluding them as religions. We have other classifications.

It sounds like you're going a long way to exclude your beliefs from the idea of religion. Are you sure this has as much to do with definition as it does with the way your subculture has characterized religion? 

>You can view it however you want. I just don't think you're going to make many meaningful arguments coming from that position. Why don't we just call every philosophy a religion?

Materialism is a comprehensive and emotionally driven philosophy that defines post 19th century culture. It's too large, disruptive, and regimented to be seen as a simple idea.

The states, after just earning their independence from a monarchy, were very distrustful in giving up certain rights to a central government.
Many states were also concerned that the more wealthy or populated states would have more influence over the new federal government and that the states would try to elect their own to positions within the new government.

Why? They both support my argument. Ultimately, Hamilton is concerned about a certain, unfit type of person becoming president, and wanted electors to make sure that doesn't happen since he didn't trust the people. He also said the president should be chosen by;
""by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station, and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation, and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice.¡±

No, it's literally not. For example, if they're lifting weights in a range that stimulates no physical adaptation that they're looking for (anything in the weight range where they could easily knock out a 20-rep set will produce endurance adaptations, which if used for aerobic exercises will burn calories at an ever decreasing rate [meaning you have to do more and more to get the same results, which are already measly], but they won't know that. So, while they're busy putting in work (mental effort/ mental accounting for energy expenditure not being an accurate representation of actual energy expended or actual work contributed towards desired results), they're going to get nothing out of it. They're not going to get the results they want and eventually they're going to quit. So, no, it really is much worse than doing nothing at all. This gives the illusion of effectiveness.

Ah yes. Doing the right thing. Something your cranky old mate Ron Paul is so familiar with, amirite? Like voting not to declare Darfur a genocide, not to recognise the contribution of Rosa Parks to the cause of civil liberties, and multiple times to prevent women from seeking abortions. Yeah, you sure know what doing the right thing is all about, don't you.

But let's talk antagonistic behavior: after feeding off of csgolounge.com for a good couple months the admins of this subreddit put up and sticky a thread inviting people to hate on /u/yaroberto and csgolounge as much as they please. Do note the wording in the OP.

Then when it gets out of hand (how could it not?) with people posting the guy's phone number and stuff the mods refuse to act. I had to call in reddit's main admins to get the stuff removed (after like 7 hours).

But yeah, making judgment calls to the best of someone's ability (/u/yaroberto on the day's matches) makes people antagonistic. Invoking and condoning witchhunts is totally cool.

I know everybody here loves /u/Coca_Cola_PR, but the truth of the matter is the dude messed up, saw what he did and then chickened out. The fact that nobody else on the Mod-team jumped in where he maybe had a bad episode doesn't do a lot to restore faith in this subreddit.

The fact that up until as I write this no remaining Mods have distanced themselves from /u/Coca_Cola_PR's behavior on that day or have even tried beginning to right his wrongs is just bad moderation. Just bad moderation.

Unbanning /u/yaroberto really is the tiniest step imaginable in starting to repair the damage done. I honestly can't believe THAT's what we're debating here. We should be talking about what we can do to make amends with csgolounge. Can you even begin to imagine what /u/yaroberto must think of this subreddit?

If you honestly think /u/yaroberto is the bad guy here all I can say is maybe get that shoulder looked at, because there seems to be a huge chip on it. The guy sucks at communicating, but at least he has always had the community's best interest at heart.

/u/Coca_Cola_PR at least came to his senses at one point. I respect him for that. But refusing to right his wrongs is not the way to honor all his time spent on building this community.

"OK, by ""hard"" polytheism I mean the curious insistence on the ""individuality"" of gods and some related notions. I am opposing it to animism. I know very little about archetypes or Jung.

Mythology is a good thing precisely because it can accommodate variation and differences. Mythology is stories, and there can be multiple ""disagreeing"" stories, and it's not a problem, because mythology is meant to be understood, not believed.

The problem with theology is that is says X is true and therefore not-X is false. This means it contradicts other theologies, and since it's all just based on feels anyway, it eventually leads to cognitive dissonance when the feels change. That's unhealthy, in my view. Mythology is also all just based on feels, ultimately, but that's not a problem because it's just telling stories rather than making definitive statements.

">Sure, some philosophers don't. But, get this, philosophers who don't have problems with basic concepts actually do accept that definition.

I responded to your claim that - ""The definition for atheism as is used by philosophers is pretty much the same as ""we"" do over here."" 

This is a debate, just as you shouldn't be expected to accept my opinion without supporting evidence, I shouldn't be expected to accept your assertion that philosophers use the lacking belief definition without some evidence to support it. 

And the evidence you supplied in your last post - a link to an IEP article - rather than supporting your claim, shows you're wrong about this. To quote from the article -

>""It has come to be widely accepted that to be an atheist is to affirm the non-existence of God."" 

They specifically say ""it has come to be widely accepted"". The IEP does then mention the lacking belief as negative atheism, but only to specifically distinguish it from the positive atheism definition they will use. 

Here is the definition they use -

>Atheism is the view that there is no God. 

So philosophers don't use the same definition we use here.

>Those are what appear to be the reasoning [ignoring what they don't want to hear, or scaring people into submission] 

It may appear that way to you, but sometimes what initially appears to us to be true, turns out to be based on a misunderstanding. They are not the reasons philosophers would reject it. 

>Even in the post you linked, the person cites sources that define atheism as the lack of belief in a god or gods to ""support"" their argument, Clearly that person is ignoring/dismissing the parts of the definition that they do not like.

No they're not. They're supporting their point that lacking belief isn't widely accepted and isn't the definition philosophers use. They say - "" [IEP] explicitly notes the distinction between this so-called ""positive atheism"" and the broader ""negative atheism"" so as to clearly note that the sense which is widely accepted and which they will use is the narrower ""positive atheism"" 


>If someone says that the term ""atheist"" meaning ""one who does not believe in a god or gods"" is too confusing for them, 

The objection isn't that ""people"" are confused by the definition, it's that the definition ""confuses the issues"". 

>For instance, if they think that atheist is too confusing because it contains within it, two possible positions (one who believes that there are no gods and one who lacks a belief in a god or gods), 

This isn't the objection though. The two possible positions it confuses are atheism and agnosticism. Using the lack of belief definition means it's not possible to distinguish between them. It also necessitates eliminating agnostic as a distinct position. Because agnostics lack belief in God they're now called atheists. But this isn't an accurate description of their position because they also lack belief in no-God. Since agnostic is a substantial and important position on the question, this feature makes the definitions unacceptable. 


>So yeah, they ignore the bits that don't support their ignorant narrative, and then pretend that it's philosophy instead of just plain and simple dishonesty.

You're being very uncharitable in your reading of that post and to the opposing view generally. It's quite insulting to call someone you disagree with dishonest and ignorant. They didn't ignore bit's that don't support their view. They were responding to particular myths and addressing them directly. 

They were rebutting claims made by some atheists that this lacking belief definition is the only correct definition. The title specifically says - ""First myth - ""That 'atheism' refers to the absence of a belief that God exists is just the correct definition of the word, as anyone who studies the issue would know..""

">. But it's fundamental to libertarianism that an individual makes better choices on important decisions than any second party deciding for him.

That isn't really fundamental to libertarianism at all. Libertarians believe that it is immoral to utilize the initiation of force to achieve a goal, regardless of the goal, so I don't see how it is a problem that individuals are imperfect. 

>If that assumption isn't true, it weakens libertarianism as a political philosophy because it suggests that societies are able to secure greater utility for citizens by, essentially, having a government which tells citizens what to do in certain cases -- obviously, that's antithetical to the claim that liberty secures the greatest personal and overall utility.

But you're not making the argument that government is better at making decisions. All that you are doing is proving that individuals aren't perfect, and theoretically a larger organization could come up with better ideas. In the sentence you quoted above, you are also conflating government with society. They are not the same thing. I'm all for society. But not government.

This is problematic. The state defines who is a serial killer/rapists, who is a paedophile, and who is a war criminal (just look at Curtis LeMay. The dude said he would be on trial for crimes if the Allies lost.)

This means that giving the state the power of the death penalty is essentially giving the state the ultimate power, the power over life and death. The ruling class, who control the state, are able to choose who lives or who dies. This is a dangerous power to allow the state to control, particularly with the panoptic zones of control we see being established around the world.

>God is all-loving but also perfectly wise. If suffering exists, then taking into account just those two qualities, we know that God not only expresses his love in suffering (e.g., the cross), but also that he has perfect reasons for allowing suffering to exist because he is perfectly wise.

I'm a bit speechless. This is some of the most anti-intellectual rhetoric I've ever heard. It basically amounts to ""Yeah, I know it doesn't make any sense at all. Don't worry about any of that stuff that sounds really horrible and unnecessary, just take comfort in knowing that god must have some good reason for doing it.""

Additionally, omnipotence should allow god to do anything. Meaning that there cannot exist a reason why he could not have done something in a different way if he wanted to. Saying ""he had a reason for doing it that way"" makes no sense, because if he is omnipotent, he can make it so instantly. The logic still defeats your argument.

Also, we know from the bible that god makes mistakes (whoa... omniscience conflict ahead).

>The Lord was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart. The Lord said, ""I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, from man to animals to creeping things and to birds of the sky; for I am sorry that I have made them"" (Gen. 6:6-7).

>I [the Lord] regret that I have made Saul king, for he has turned back from following Me and has not carried out My commands (1 Sam. 15:11)

Is it not possible god made mistakes when creating the universe, because he is flawed? And then, at that point, isn't it more plausible that the reason there are so many flaws in the theology is because it was written by bronze age people and isn't actually true?

Update: [Here's a wheel you can spin to get a selection of popular Tesla FUD!]( http 
____

BTW., here's a quick example of how Reuters, despite the neutral language they usually use in their reporting, could end up scoring so high on the FUD tracker.

Consider the following recent Reuters article:

> ""Tesla shares skid further on concern over Model 3, report on brake test""
>
> (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) shares closed sharply lower on Tuesday amid analyst skepticism about its Model 3 cars and a news report that said the company had stopped running a brake test on its cars.

Here's the various tools of FUD Reuters used in that article:

- Note the summary: it's a technically correct but misleading summary of Tesla's decision to test every Model 3 on the track, and a misleading summary that some (perma-bear) analysts are skeptical. Reading that sentence a reader could get the (false) impression that all analysts are skeptical - which is not true.
- Also note the ambiguity of the ""skepticism about its Model 3 cars"" wording: the real skepticism was mainly about Tesla's ability to meet high demand. The wording could also be understood that there's some kind of problem with the Model 3.
- They then continue the article by quoting ""surprise"" about lower delivery numbers in Q2 - without mentioning the well-known 200,000 U.S. deliveries limit Tesla was running up against in Q2 even a single time. Readers are left with the false impression that Tesla was somehow unable to deliver.
- They later on clarify the brake test news by adding more detail - but many readers only read the headline and the first few sentences. The interleaving of the Q2 delivery numbers information unnecessarily increased the amount of time it took for readers to get to the real information.
- They also quote Business Insider's biased reporting - a well-known source of Tesla FUD, without mentioning the poor track record of Business Insider Tesla reporting and the various controversies their reporting suffered from in the past.
- Note that later in the article they are also first quoting the analyst with the lowest price target for TSLA (without mentioning their poor record of predictions), before quoting analysts with higher targets.
- There are some positive Tesla quotes in the article as well: dead last, read by the fewest readers.

Again I'll say you've obviously never experienced living with someone with severe social anxiety. Many times there is very little difference between not speaking with them and speaking with them.

I said that everyone chases right after you, not that everyone is a dick. Don't put words into my mouth.

> It's not. No where did I say that it was optimal. I'm just stating that you can't possibly lump every single player into the same mindset- fact is, everyone will play and think differently. This was my point.

You did say it. You said that it was a good idea to try to take down the invader first. It's not, really.

> I'm not jumping to his defense. I'm simply pointing out that it is not a 'gank' that we are seeing- that he just invaded into a world with a phantom, and a blue was summoned.

Yeah, you are? You even defended the host from points I didn't make right off the bat. Hell, if you didn't care about defending the host, then why are you arguing about topics unrelated to the actual argument (the fact that this is by definition a would-be gank) in defense of host and against invaders? Totally because it helps your argument! Spoilers: it doesn't.

> Maybe if you're stuck in a corner by them. But, if you're having a problem with people R1 spamming at you (even multiple people), then I'd suggest looking more in to fighting more than one person at a time- it's not incredibly difficult.

Um, no, you can very easily die to R1 spam because you can get hit way more than the regular 2 hit combo because of the fact that it's multiple people. Also... yes, it is difficult. Even if your opponents are pretty bad all they have to do is approach you and R1. You're probably used to seeing videos of Peeve, Oroboro, and other skilled PvPers who are fifty leagues above your opponent. If you aren't that much better than them then your chances of beating them aren't looking good.

> You didn't say that- but you definitely made it sound like the invader (i.e., the one trying to initiate PvP by halting someone elses' progress) was the one we should be pitying, because he had to fight the three of them. Guess what? That's what happens when you invade- yes it's weighted to be more towards worlds with phantoms in them, but this is nothing new to the series. People can (and will, if they feel the need) summon phantoms to defend themselves. Invaders have always had the chance of having to go up against multiple people.

Have you ever invaded? Or ever even seen all the complaints about how terribly one-sided invasions are in DS3? That whole paragraph of yours is pretty damn silly in the eyes of anyone that actually knows why DS3 invasions aren't the same. Just because you invaded someone without their consent doesn't mean that the game should fuck you sideways for it. It being so unfair for invaders is not a thing that has always been in the series; just look at DS2 lol. You could get invaded while being unable to summon help and being at 50% hp. Now? Almost always only if you have a buddy with you (who also gets estus and can be re-summoned as many times as you want) and you get +30% HP. Uh-huh. Exactly the same.

So yeah, I do pity invaders. Or have you never seen the gifs of people spawning right into a 4-man squad (who are just getting through the level) and getting instantly and unavoidably collectively R1ed the hell out of there?

> I don't think they ""planned"" anything other than going through the level together. The blue definitely wasn't in on any plan, since he got randomly selected to help out. It just so happened that it turned into a 3-on-1- there was no planning of any of it involved. There was no ""ganking"".

Dude, absolutely great work taking my sentences out of context! I didn't say they set-up a gank squad, for like the 5th time. By ""planned"" I thought it was pretty obvious that I meant ""made up their minds to"" or ""were trying to"" gank.

Also, please. Are you seriously defending a blue from being a ganker? Or that he wasn't planning on teaming up on an invader with unfair advantage over him? LMAOOOO

Sorry but that's just fucking absurd. The Blades of the Darkmoon is a covenant which entire fucking purpose is to outnumber and gank invaders. If you're in it, then you know that you are going to be summoned into a fight you have a huge chance of winning because you will always outnumber your opponents. That's why whenever I summon a blue, I leave them to fight the invader on their own. Because I know how much it fucking sucks to get ganked by 2-3 guys at once and being unable to do anything about it because they're not idiots like the ones on this gif.

> First, you cannot say with 100% certainty that they did it solely because he was a player and they just wanted to kill him (for ""kicks"", i believe you put it) with absolutely nothing else on their mind. That's just not possible. Second- of course they want to kill him. Like I said- he's solely there to kill them, and will do it any way possible. Getting rid of him sooner than later is just playing smart, not having wild bloodlust.

No, I can't say it with 100% assurance that they get a kick out of ganking players. But if they're chasing after the invader like that then chances are that since everyone likes winning, and beating a player in PvP is winning, that they indeed do it because they want to win and not because stupidly chasing an invader down, ignoring literally everything else in the way because of how concentrated the hosts are in their future mashing of the R1 button, leaving a horde of enemies running after you and who knows how many items behind is optimal (there you go again saying that it's optimal while using different words then saying you didn't say anything of the sort, too). Like, dude... Look at the gif this very thread is about and tell me again, with a straight face, that chasing after the invader mindlessly was a good move.

I'll spoil the answer for you: It wasn't a good idea to chase the invader like that because all 3 of the would-be gankers instantly died to the explosive barrels.

> Clearly this isn't 100% the case, since it seems that plenty of people agreed with me already in that it wasn't a gank- along with a few other posts in this thread.

Yeah. Those people also got their share of downvotes, hence the controversial symbol on their upvote count. Or they don't have that symbol and are just at negative or no upvotes.

And because you got 40 people to upvote you doesn't really mean that they think this isn't a gank? For all you know they upvoted you to collectively congratulate the OP (which they should). Seeing how people who only said ""this isn't a gank"" were downvoted, and you, who said something I see worth upvoting for besides that were not, I'd say that a good part if not most of those people ""agreeing"" with you aren't doing it over the semantics.

Even then, I'll repeat how this isn't suddenly not a would-be gank just because some people agreed with you on it.

> Yes, they are. Like I said- I'm 100% on-board with invaders. I love them. However, by invading, you are 100% going into their world with the mission to kill them and steal an Ember/Shackle/Whatever, simply for your own benefit, and setting them back in any progress they may have made. Regardless of how you look at it.

Yeah, uuuh, so? What's the point of this part? People don't invade for the rewards most of the time, either, but rather, because we enjoy chaotic, ruleless PvP. Doesn't mean that the game should be designed in an unfair way. Also, again, please stop acting like if every host and his phantoms are an innocent little nooblet. They very clearly enjoy beating you most of the time. That's why they taunt and celebrate. If they didn't care of the invader they'd do the smart thing and ignore them to get to the fog.

">Lol do you want me to go gather stats for you?

I want you to back up your claim, as I don't believe it but am willing to be proven wrong. Do you stand by your argument, or are you blowing smoke? 

>Now if you go to any thread where the game is mentioned, most people will be talking about what a let down it was. 

Proof by contradiction: let's assume what you said is true. I apply that criterion to the post I just linked to. I do a count of people who like the game, people who dislike the game, and people who mentioned the game but weren't easily classified. 

Like: 24

Dislike: 5

Can't classify: 7

Even in that quick and dirty count, there were far more people liking it than disliking it. So your statement is disproven - at least some threads have people liking Octopath Traveler, so you can't rely on that generalization as evidence. 

>Also r/octopathtraveler isnt ""thriving""

Admittedly an unclear definition. Define thriving. I'd call 20K+ subscribers from an install base of 1 million+ thriving. A comparable number of posts per day to /r/JRPG. More subscribers than some entire series (Dragon Quest with 18.9K). So no, I'm not exaggerating. I'm setting my standards according to similar Reddits. 

>Also you know that a highly rated game can be mediocre right? A rating does not define a games quality. 

Sure. That said, I would need a good argument for why the initial reviews were wrong. I'd need evidence. I'd need logical support. Simply saying that reviews aren't 100% accurate does not justify taking a converse position. 

>There are plenty of mainstream games that are nothing more than recycled garbage yet they constantly get 10/10s.

Evidence lacking. Also irrelevant, since we're not talking about ""plenty of mainstream games,"" but Octopath Traveler. 

>When I said the game was mediocre, I wasnt talking about the score, the score is irrelevant. The game itself is mediocre 

Right, and I called that an exaggeration and appealed to several sources of evidence. None of my sources are definitive; I agree that reviews, that user ratings, that thread comments aren't 100% reliable. That said, they are somewhat reliable; they provide a counterargument that you need to build a case against if you want more people to agree with you. 

So here's where we are: you insist Octopath Traveler is mediocre, but seem unwilling to provide any evidence or arguments to support your case. I think that's an exaggeration, and I'm providing counterarguments to see if you can elaborate in some way. I already disagree with you. You disagree with me. Are you going to provide any more detail to make this conversation worthwhile for both of us, or are you going to double-down on what you're saying but continue to refuse to support your ideas with evidence?

A ""review"" is not limited to a 5 page essay posted on a gaming website. A review could come from a user on a forum, or just a friend or co-worker talking to you about a game in real life. I doubt your friends have all been paid off by gaming companies to give you biased reviews.

> You would have hated Rosa Parks, eh? Illegal bitch should have stayed on her side of the bus.

> PROTIP: Just because it's illegal doesn't mean it's wrong.

While that might have some truth to it, you cannot possibly compare video game piracy to racism. Seriously, this is just as bad as pulling the ""nazi"" card, and comparing DRM to hitler. The analogy does not hold up. When you pirate something, you are taking someone's hard work without permission. If you cannot see that, that is wrong, without it being illegal, then there is something wrong with your moral compass.

"> I do think that notion is far removed from reality. Just like I think the notion of native Americans somehow retaking the US is unrealistic. I don't necessarily think it's okay for indigenous ethnic groups to disappear, I just don't care very much about that and see it as essentially inevitable, at least in certain places. 

You are making another false equivalence. Native Americans and white Americans are not analogous groups. The matter of changing the ethnic battle in the US to favor whites is mostly a legal one. It is a question of what we as whites allow others to do. Comparing that with native Americans who are a 5 million or so people ""retaking"" the US is childish. If you still feel the notion is far removed I would have to get better justifications than that. 
(Just on a personal note the idea of white ethnic extinction being inevitable reeks of white submissivism. Such loser mentality is pathetic, weak and disgusting. Go lift some weights.)

> Mainly because that's what tends to happen (the problem of induction, I know). My view of the AR is that it's an unpopular fringe movement, do you not see yourself this way? If I had to guess, I would say that the AR causing serious changes is about as likely as the Communist Party USA doing so. 

The notion of multiracial, multicultural nations was a radical one as well 70 years ago. Yet here we are. The UK leaving the EU was considered radical and openly laughed at 13 years ago, yet here we are. I feel your view on politics and how political change occurs is not very realistic. In most countries far right groups that gain momentum are eaten up by the bigger softer right groups to gain voters. The political will of the far right gets pushed forward that way. The existence of AR talking points spreads even if they don't carry the brand. An example would be UKIP and Nigel Farage pushing Brexit into reality.(not saying either are AR, just an example of fringe political movements reaching their goals.) 

> I don't know much about Brexit and the AR but Trump has said some pretty unfavorable things[...] maneuvering, doesn't that seem to imply that the AR is at least not going to get any political power in the very near future?

The AR doesn't need direct political power to get its will across. But no, to me it does not imply that. No one here expects Spencer and Anglin to be called up for the next administration. We expect guys who hide their power level or guys who do our bidding because they want our votes. The AR brand is unpopular but the ideas behind it are not.

> This might be just a semantics difference, but I would probably call that a revolution still, even if it's somewhat of a return to a previous state. Returning to the state of nature, for example, I would also call a revolution. 

Again, a false equivalence. Repealing laws that where put in place 50 years ago is not analogous to returning to the ""state of nature"". I could agree that it is a revolution like the passing of the laws in the first place was a revolution. But the word ""revolution"" in that case sounds inflationary to me. 

> Isn't the idea of creating an ethnostate where one does not currently exist also relatively untested? The one example I can think of (Israel) has had a lot of conflict. 

I don't understand where you get the idea that an ethnostate never existed in the US. I already showed you how the US was an ethnostate since its inception up until Hart-Celler in 65'. The ethnostate is the default. Modern day European countries are ethnostates that very recently stopped enforcing their borders and replaced the benefit of the people living within those borders with the benefit of outsiders. Before WW1 almost all countries in Europe where ethnostates like they had been for hundreds of years. The case of Israel is a pointless one since jews never had a country before. The Europeans already have their countries. They just need to enforce their borders and protect their sovereignty from outside influence. It's a question of legal enforcement and not, out of the blue, nation building. Same goes for the US. 


> Because your options are cede to fight another day or die. [...] I don't think that's a realistic goal, especially given current trends. 

I disagree with what you think the options are. It is far easier to impact US laws from within the US than it is to secede from the US. But in any case what you are talking about is already happening. There are large groups of whites creating clusters and enclaves around the US. There is no reason to not fight the battle at a local and a national level at the same time. 

And again, you lean on the current trends like a crutch as if there is no way to reverse them when you can do so easily(look at artificial baby booms in Denmark). ",1

they are not customs either. Both Grimsmo and Hoback use a CNC to grind their blades. They use a CNC to cut all the milled out pockets, designs, and all the stop bar tracks etc. The only thing they do is finish the knife and ensure it is mechanically sound. Hoback did customs in the past, but not since he went full out with the CNC production of his stuff. they're about as 'custom' as a MSC ""performance series"", if that...at least Mick grinds the blades on those. 

then you have makers like peter carey and allen elishewitz, mayo, nalu, foster, ochs, barajas, rexford, southard, SIBERT...even emerson... that make the same model knife, but with multiple types of high end materials, with complications...inlays, pivot rings, clips etc which are cut out, profiled, milled, pantographed and then hand fitted, not to mention dovetailing bolsters, shadowboxing frames, texturing..along with contouring and finishing. Makers like Burch utilize a CNC to help them cut out parts, but finish everything by hand, including grinding the blade, cutting locks and fitment.

Let's take your own example of Skyrim. Each race speaks a diffrent language, elves speak elvish, norse speak nordish, red guard speak whatever language theirs is called, and so on and so on.

Highly emotive, relatable and probably the complete opposite of the Brechtian mold).

Since you've already forgotten your original comment, I'll remind you of the reason you got that response...""Well there has to be a god for one to be against one...lol"". 

Communism is an economic AND a political system. The reason Communists are atheists is because Karl Marx, one of the people responsible for Communism, rejected it outright (Quote: Religion is opium of the people).

I brought up the correlation because Communist countries are societies which reject religion completely. I was pointing out the flaw in your thinking that religion is responsible for the violence in the world. It isn't. If that were true, Communist nations would be some of the most peaceful societies in the world since they do not embrace religion. The truth of the matter is that people and life are more complex than you appear to recognize. There is good and bad in every socio-economic spectrum of the world.

>...the issue is many fans of these old works see them as the actual word of a real sky monster and relevant to issues today in their full ""literal interpretation"".

You're referring to orthodox or fundamentalist believers. The important thing to remember here is that religious believers are not a monolithic group. Religious beliefs exist on a sliding scale, not unlike the political spectrum. As such, it is not uncommon for political/religious moderates, such as myself, to butt heads with fundamentalists in both the political and religious arena. Those who espouse extremist religious views are often the most extreme elements of religious followers, the American Taliban if you will. These people are also most often the ones espousing an authoritarian form of governance (e.g., Ted Cruz, FAR right wing Conservatives, etc.). You will never find moderate elements of most religions and political groups espousing the abject nonsense we often hear coming from extremists for the simple reason that they recognize it violates the fundamental tenets of their religious and social values. The best elements of this nation's founding principles came from moderate religious elements of our society.

>It's the ramblings of bronze age nomads when the modern church doesn't want to go along with it and the word of god when they want to settle the tax status of married homosexuals.

Contrary to your derisive view of fundamental religious tenets and principles, they have stood the test of time. If you can point to a better set of tenets and principles, feel free to share what they happen to be. I'm open-minded enough to consider better principles and values, but I have yet to see any from those who claim to have them. Why do I think most religious principles and values are as relevant today as they were when they were proposed? I've witnessed people who applied those principles in life succeed and those who rejected them fail repeatedly for close to 5 decades. I have discovered the very same outcome by delving throughout world history.

>Who could possibly say blind faith cannot be correct sometimes? Who would use the fact that blind faith can be correct as evidence that something is correct?

I didn't stake the absolutist position on religion or the unknown...you did.

>I can't fathom the motivation to engage in this other than knowing people like belonging to a group and thinking they are better than other groups.

You're touching on an aspect of humanity that's true for some people (i.e., the need by some to belong to one group or another). That's true of every socio-economic spectrum of society, including many within the atheist community. From personal experience, I have never found that most religious believers worship in order to belong to a social group as much as to form closer ties to God. It's a very personal choice. Are there some who worship for social reasons? Yes, but they're missing the point of faith and worship...to worship God and gain spiritual enrichment, not to join social cliques. To expand on this somewhat, most people's religious affiliations are based upon the denominations they are born into. Many people switch denominations as they age, but that's simply because they find that different denominations are a better match for their personal views/values.

"While you have a point to make, there are several errors in your thinking here. 

First, the definition of inflation involves rising prices. That may usually involve movement in the money supply or not, but that doesn't change the definition of the word. 

Second, inflation is not always caused by an increase in the money supply, and an increase in the money supply does not always cause inflation. For an example of the latter point, consider a liquidity trap and Japan over the 1990's. Increase the money supply is irrelevant in a situation with zero interest rates because holding money is equivalent to holding bonds, and so it may be very difficult to generate inflation despite a wild increase in the money supply. For an example of the former, consider weather shocks that increase the cost of food, or global demand shocks that increase the cost of natural resources. Those have nothing to do with money supply increases.

"There is some truth in the blog. She's right that Bethenny is weirdly making Jules' eating disorder about her and her experiences dealing with her mother. Like, I can get where Bethenny is coming from there, but Jules is correct that it is an awfully self-absorbed take on the situation.

She's also totally correct that the bus convo between Bethenny and Dorinda was pretty shitty. And she is right to bring up the Hamptons visit, which was just incredibly poor behavior on Bethenny and Carole's part.

But a lot of her points had me rolling my eyes. Her interpretation of Carole's ""Oh Jesus!"" was quite different from mine. Granted, she was THERE, I was not, and it had to do with HER. But when I hear ""Oh Jesus,"" I consider it an exclamation of dismay. I thought Carole WAS being sympathetic in that moment for Jules' relapse, not criticizing her. The denial comment came in a talking head that was filmed who knows how much later.

As for Bethenny and Carole feeling that Jules' anger was coming out of nowhere -- yeah. I did too. Again, they actually lived this, we just get a highly edited version of things. But I find it ironic that Jules starts out her blog talking about how she doesn't understand why this group is constantly dominated by women bursting in and out of rooms screaming at one another when SHE was the person who did that this episode. She showed up at that dinner ratcheted up by Dorinda Meddler (and also, I suspect, by producers who wanted her to add some spice to the mix) and popped off over issues Bethenny and Carole didn't even know Jules HAD. They admitted to discussing the eating disorder, including at the pizza-making party. But the idea that they were badmouthing Jules' marriage appear to have come from absolutely nothing more than Jules' paranoia. (And, knowing what we know now, Jules had every right to be paranoid -- but about Michael, not her castmates.) Had Jules said to Bethenny and Carole, ""Hey, guys, I need to talk to you about something; I don't think you're being sensitive about my eating disorder,"" I suspect the situation would have played out much differently. But she came in loaded for bear, Bethenny and Carole were dealing with a human claymore exploding in their faces, and they got defensive. I would have too.

As for Jules' point that Bethenny apparently just decides when she can move on from personal slights against her -- yeah. We ALL do that. Do you mean to tell me you've never been pissed off at a friend, backed off, and then after a period of time reconnected and picked things back up? That happens in real life all the time. One of the other elements people on the show, and on this sub, rarely acknowledge is that, after Bethenny loses her shit on someone, she frequently apologizes to them because she knows it was wrong. You can argue that it's not sincere, or an act, but again -- I do the same thing. All the time. In the heat of the moment, sometimes you just lose it. And after you come down, you realize you said things you shouldn't have. Bethenny has done that with Sonja and Luann this season. I won't be surprised if Jules doesn't end up doing that with Bethenny in an episode or two. I don't get why this is somehow poor behavior.

I also will maintain that Carole was not wrong with her comment, in both this episode and last week's blog, that friends talk about each other behind their backs. WHERE IS THE LIE? Seriously. Get off the high horse and get real. ",0

That's a simulated reality. No need for emergence. Do you agree with this?

>We're talking about emergence, not the number of times you can play a video game.

Emergence of what? 

This is not about how many times you can play the SIMS game. Its about how many sims games you can create . If we can build one we have to assume that many more will be built. 

Lets take simple steps and see where its going wrong.

1) There can be only one base reality. 

2)If we create a simulated universe then we can assume that many more will be built. 

3)If there si only one reality and more than one simulated realities then our chances of being in a simulated one is higher . 

Do you agree with these claims. 

>Your argument is analogous to the strong anthropic principle. You're insinuating that intelligence and technology are some kind of end game as if the universe is in some sense compelled to eventually have technologically advanced life emerge within it.

You are still at stuck at the same place.

Forget it all. 

Just think about the sims example. Some guy , tomorrow creates an update to the SIMS game and it gives them the ability of consciuosness. From then on , in an instant , with no emergence , that guy will create a simulated universe. Do you agree with this?

Listen kid, I'm an atheist. My parents are atheists. I've been to church maybe twice. I don't believe in God. 

However, just because I lack faith doesn't mean I lack understanding. That is something you lack. And your analogy is shit, mind you. I don't ""go around the internet"" attacking /r/atheism, I don't declare how much I hate the subreddit at every chance I'm given... I really don't care about anything on the internet that much. I just don't like how the majority of the subreddit is cut from the same cloth as yourself. Holier than thou ""zealots"" who disregard common ettiquette because they think they're Hitchens reincarnate, on a mandate to squash the islamo-fascists before they can break down the front door. And how the fuck can somebody be ideologically opposed to something which doesn't exist? Atheism isn't a thing, it's the lack of a thing (namely, belief). 

I write this last paragraph specifically to help you. It's obvious that you've latched on to atheism as a sort of self-aggrandizing intellectual pursuit. That's fine",1

"To be perfectly honest, I thought you were initially trolling or just trying to start a debate. I meant no offense, was just trying to present examples of why I thought your point was absurd. I assumed you would not actually find those things a turn on - that was my point. Most people, because of an instinct to seek genetic variance, would find such examples repulsive. I don't need to present evidence beyond centuries of the illegality of incest for that one. 

The Crastor's wife thing may have sounded rude, but I was just referring to the hottest series on tv right now - which also happens to be full of incest. Perhaps that was silly to include. I'm just saying that our morals probably have some basis in instinct, and instinct says incest is always wrong. Weird in nature is wrong. As we become more sophisticated individually as well as societally, weird becomes more understandable, sometimes more acceptable, but on principle ""weird"" is what everybody says is weird, regardless of what you or I think. 

Why don't you point to a single shred of evidence, anecdotal or otherwise, of someone who found their sweetheart in a biological parent? It wouldn't matter if you could because it would still be extraordinarily abnormal. The closest I can think of is Woody Allen. Again I say weird.

The coin itself isn't terrible and I like the idea of having larger blocks while we're waiting for the more long term solutions to come out, but the people posting here make me firmly believe alot of ",1
"1) Well, okay. I can't change your mind on this, and quite frankly, I accept some of what you are saying. But a few points. One: alot of these things only have one or two avenues to how they work, based on what we know of them. We know that the Lymans Ear and Neuroglottis are replacements, that the pre-omnor is just a pre-fill sack, etc. There are, in fact, alot of organs one may even consider superfluous. But guess what, you didn't have to read it, and your opinions, whilst sometimes interesting, aren't that constructive. I was setting out to do something for fun; not to change the face of the lore, or facilitate a discussion for you to have. I just wanted to put out some extra info to cover how I think they may work. You can disagree, and you can move on, but devaluing something because it wasn't what YOU wanted at that current time, is more then a little petty. On top of that, people like you are actually preventing many of the speculative options you claim to want, as if my explanations differ even slightly from the lore, it gets lambasted. BTW, the oolotic kidney would likely require a dedicated arterial channel able to intercept the flow of both renal arteries and channel it through the organ and directly into one of the major posterior arteries. There, question answered.

2) You asserted that it would be possible, under a hormone-dependent form of Astartes transformation process (the biscopea and ossmodula functions) for present-day humanity to create something similar. This was meant as a refutation of that concept, based on some of the many, many things we are missing.

3) Hormones can lead to structural changes. This is what you are failing to grasp. Your view of hormones is actually surprisingly limited for someone who claims to have a higher level of scientific understanding then me. Put simply, HGH is one of the key hormones involved in osteogenesis, with its application in that capacity somewhat guided by other hormones, such as estrogen and testosterone. IF we are accepting that the hormone produced by the Ossmodula over-rides these hormones, including the programming hormones, then, should one have a knowledge of genetics and biology far in advance of our own, it would be possible to trigger the Osteoblasts to grow bone in a formation that deviates from the natural human form, thus allowing a higher and denser growth of muscle through specialized artificial growth hormone and myostatin inhibition. This also applies to the expansion of tissue within the internal organs of the body, such as the kidneys, lungs, heart, and circulatory system: growth in vivo is triggered through hormones, and if we substitute human growth hormones for those that create transhuman results (currently an impossibility) then the effect would be to fundamentally alter the biology of the individual. The Astartes, by the way, have never been mentioned as receiving muscular implants. That is not a canon part of the lore, nor would it be particularly useful compared to the growth of muscle going hand-in-hand with unnatural skeletal development. Now that's not to say that it is the only factor, and I never said it was. In fact, I conceded, earlier on, that most organs likely fulfill a secondary function in releasing a targeted retrovirus that enhances the biology by introducing a section of engineered genetic material. But what we know of biology, not just human but animal as well, says that any growth must have a hormonal trigger. You can't refute that. Even if we are dealing with retroviral genetic manipulation, the trigger must still be hormonal in nature.

4) You see, I thought that you were referring to retrovirals as the sole creator. If you are saying it must be a part of the process that goes hand in hand with the hormonal releases of the Ossmodula, we are in agreement. In fact, it would also be one of the best explanations as to why the first implanted organ is the heart: it is the best vector through which to introduce a retroviral gene-modding agent to the host, prepping them for future enhancements and lowering the risk of rejection. Also, my post was mainly focused on what they do when they are functioning. For instance, during function, the Catalespan node is introducing asymmetric neurotransmitters segregated to specific portions of the brain to simulate action in slow-wave sleep (deep sleep). It is the loss of REM that causes psychological problems in the Marine if overuse becomes a factor.

5) Ah, when you said muscle insertions I assumed you meant as a transplant, but you were actually referring to the different sections of the muscle. Now, I will certainly admit that the structure of muscles is governed in no small part by genetics... HOWEVER, the mechanism of action that leads to this change, and its appearance later in life, is, as in all human growth, hormonally based. The genetics of a person determine how the hormonal balance of the body will grow the muscles, not what the completed structure will look like. Now, in regards to the SM's, the structure of these muscles is determined by the Biscopea. The books don't say anything else on the matter, but using that, and an understanding of biology, it is clear that the biscopea controls growth patterns using inhibiting agents, as well as regulating factors that could themselves be inhibitors, such as myostatins. That kind of science is leagues beyond what we have now, and would require the genetics of the individual altered, but, and this is important, no growth of any kind occurs without a biological system producing its action hormonally.

6) Hormones, programmed in, reacting with genetic material predisposed for a certain growth patter, will grow the joints in a different pattern. Now, this is still likely going to share a massive similarity to a human joint, however there will be important differences. Chief among these differences is that the biology of the individual is predisposed to rapid healing and recovery, meaning that what, in a human, would be worn down to nothing is, in an Astartes, constantly replenished. Additionally, the structure of ligaments in the joint will likely include many redundancies that baseline humans lack. For example, the ACL will have additional supporting ligamenture, as well as simply being of a greater material quality. This will be found throughout the rest of the body, most notably in the major skeletal joints. It's actually not that difficult to imagine how these joints would work.

In regards to the brain, it depends on what you consider to be a major structural change, and what you consider to be the mode of action of their mental changes. Currently, we can say that the majority of the structure of the Aspirants brain is set in stone when they are inducted; the only major changes to lobe size and structure are the growth of the visual cortex related to the occulobe, the catalespan node, and the Sus'an Membrane. Now, all three of these are major, but their effects wouldn't increase the intelligence of a Marine. Genetic alteration doesn't explain it alone, as, as I have already stated, most growth, including practically all synapse growth, is complete by the time the Aspirant is inducted. Thus, the question becomes; how do you grow the brain? Now, we could argue that there must be a further growth of synapses, but that would require both genetic alteration to reactivate the stem-cell properties of neural tissue (or the addition of stem-cells through, for example, the catalespan node), and hormonal triggers to allow that growth to occur. Alternatively, we could make the case that the major changes to the brain are not grown in, but rather trained in through hypnotherapy, allowing patterns of thought that would be incomprehensible for normal humans to be easily developed. Personally, I have to lean towards a mix of the two, as the Astartes brain needs to process data from various additional organs in an autonomic fashion, and the human brain doesn't have the space for that to occur, but without the correct training on these new centers, administered via hypnotherapy, they would likely be little more then useless chunks of grey matter.

7) Once again, I was doing a thought exercise, and comparing something outside of reality to in-reality counterparts. In some cases, there was nothing to expand on, as the structure of ears is far too complex to speculate about how a perfectly engineered one would present. In regards to their interlocking functions, I don't know, apart from the Biscopea and Ossmodula, what exactly you are referring to. Are you referring to the second hearts interaction with the multi-lung (big surprise, hearts and lungs go together) the larramans organ, or the oolotic kidney (organs whose action is dependent on the circulatory system interact with the organ in the circulatory system)? Is it about the action of the preomnor and the omophagea (there isn't one, the omophagea is in the stomach)? What organ have I failed to recognised to your satisfaction? Let me know.

8) Wikipedias best use in research is as a launching ground into actual reputable sources.

9) You disagree with my assessment of the betchers gland? How so? The glands produce a metal-corrosive venom. In the human body, even stomach acid requires a major mucus membrane to avoid damaging the walls of the stomach, and this is a great deal more corrosive then that. Thus, it must have a form of acid-resistant mucus. When excreting the venom, this mucus must also be excreted to the surrounding area so as to prevent tissue damage. The glands must be operated by a specific muscle group, or they wouldn't be able to shoot the venom at a variable pressure, and the venom must be produced in-gland, because the body lacks a system for transmitting corrosives. What do you think the method of action is?

>However, the issue I'm having is from the arguments made by those who claim homosexuality isn't sinful due to problems translating greek to english, perspectives of the biblical authors, and the idea that Jesus was NOT refuting homosexuality in his answer on divorce to the pharisees--the argument here being that Jesus was answering a specific question, to specific people, in a method that they would understand and relate to and that it has nothing to do with homosexuality. This argument makes sense, but isn't completely solid. But even the least bit of doubt would put this concept in a danger zone where we could be, well, wrong. It's not like our interpretations of the Bible haven't been wrong before--except in this case we are condemning people who shouldn't be condemned, so to me this is a highly important subject where we need to find out ALL the information instead of rely on past understanding.

>which you are then using to discount any of the rational and thought out points I've made.

While some of your thoughts/arguments have been logical, they all seem to terminate as soon as they get too messy/conflicting, and you seem to fall back on the idea that that just means God's intent is really complex, and more investigation is needed to uncover his true meaning. Why can't the messy conflicts be due to the reasons I've proposed?

If that's the case, please explain how you know that.

I am here for some healthy discussion, but I've found that arguing over specific points of doctrine is unproductive, because the process or at the very least starting assumptions between myself and the person I'm debating with aren't the same. The point of me asking you to clarify your assumptions and why you assume them above is to clear up the ground the discussion is based on, and make sure we're not wasting time debating particulars, when we don't actually agree on the basics. 

>Yeah, we are currently using the same system which may hit some kinks every now and then but continued, honest search yields truth.

Evidence-based arguments are often made by apologetics to support these assumptions, but¡ªas you have been doing¡ªevidence that contradicts those assumptions are dismissed as needing further investigation, which just means you're cherry picking your data.

>you seem to have a faulty understanding of what Faith is and what it does for the Christian.

If you think so, then please provide me with your definition of faith, and I can then tell you whether or not I disagree with it and why. You claim to have done this at the end of your post, but as near as I can tell, all you said was:

1: Only faith in Jesus/God is required of Christians.
>Faith - required in one place Biblically, and that is essentially the core concept that Jesus is God. It does not and cannot stand alone as it says many times that misplaced faith is just as bad as no faith at all.

2: I'm defining faith thusly:
>Faith -The inherent belief that anything told to us by claim of Jesus or otherwise is inherently true and requires no further analysis. This faith is more important than reason because it's deeper, and therefore it can be at direct odds with logic or evidence and still be true.

3: Obviously, there's a difference between our definitions of faith.
>As you can see, actual the faith we have as Christians is much different than the way you are defining it. So what do you say we stop discounting my reasoning simply because you wrongly defined Faith then assumed it to be my stance. (Which again, would be plainly seen as false if you had read anything in this sub.)

But you never defined what faith is explicitly, so I don't see what basis you're claiming a disagreement with me. I'm sure you do disagree, but you haven't properly articulated your opposing view yet, so please do so.

>And since every single post you've made so far has made that same presupposition and poisoned the well to where you now regret speaking to me about my faith on a sub specifically made for such people: well let's just say I admire your faith.

In fact that's the last goddamn thing they're gonna wanna hear, and they're gonna wonder why that's the first thing you say. What they are gonna want to hear about are the fucking white men in masks threatening the fucking people of color. They're gonna want to have a conversation about that, shocking as that may be.

"Okay let me talk about each piece you've shown me.

1. This website seems very shaky for credibility, I've looked at the author of the article and they have shown no qualifications for him, so I'll just have to assume that they know what they talk about (although it is unlikely, considering it's some random news website with no qualifications shown for authors)
The quote from the website about the relevant subject ""Some even believe these ideas went too far, like Dr. Sanjay Gupta, famous for his studies related to the theory of advanced quantum hydroponics. ""It's like, one big atom? Forget about it, man. Even weirder is, like, if we're just one big atom in a larger universe, how do we know all the little atoms don't have, you know, little universes in them, with little people living on them, with little cars and little houses, and maybe even itsy-bitsy tiny[...] international symposiums on cutting-edge theoretical physics, even.""""

After searching up Dr. Sanjay Gupta and advanced quantum hydroponics (hydroponics has nothing to do with quantum studies, hydroponics is a way of growing food very efficiently) I found that the original article talking about this theory was made by The Onion, a well known PARODY NEWS WEBSITE!
( link:  http  )

2. This shows no evidence and is purely speculative, it doesn't even actually touch on the subject you say it does! The author also has shown no qualifications.

3. This is the daydreaming of a (presumably high school) student, there is no evidence shown to prove it, and there are actually alternatives offered which act counter to it!

4. The simpsons... the simpsons aren't known to be very scientifically accurate, and after all, this is joke.

This is just... mind numbingly against every part of the scientific method. There is no evidence, there is nothing that it is built off. All of theoretical physics is an extension of our current knowledge of the universe, not a contradiction of known physical entities. This is not theoretical physics, this is pseudo-scientific daydreaming.

I'm just really terrified that someone who is un-medicated and really unstable/suicidal really can't take those kind of harsh critical words. They teeter on a line of thinking that I'd be better off without them and have had recent self-harm nights so I don't think that would be in my best interest of making them feel loved and keeping them safe and stable. 

> Your SO needs to know that it's not them specifically that's causing you to feel this way, but their unwillingness to help you help them.

I think this is something I'll be focusing on with them, I am worried I'll be accused of being ""manipulative"" if I say ""hey this makes me feel really anxious if you don't get meds or go to therapy"" because that has been a response I've gotten before.

But maybe it's all in the way I say it, and usually it's over texting which can be rife with misunderstandings.

What's interesting about the patient/carer dynamic is that they have criticized me for acting like their parent/therapist. And that I ""baby"" them too much. So it's obvious that I find myself falling into this role, which bothers them. Though they do say that they love it when I ""take care of them"" and ""spoil them"" when they feel depressed, but they hate it when I do the same thing when they're manic or I guess fairly middle-ground as well.

I'll be the first to admit, a lot of the things and apprehensions I have against bringing negative thoughts from me to them is my own anxieties on the matter. Early on in the relationship I was not able to communicate those dark parts of me well and they were very unattached and distant because of it. There was some... infidelity-ish things going on and drug abuse at that time as well. But honestly I don't think they remember most of that half of the year, it was a really intense episode.

I actually talked to them last night about how stressed I feel about being tired and sad all the time, and feeling guilty for even going to therapy or considering looking for medication. I told them I wondered if I had Borderline-PD or ADHD / anxiety or depression and that I feel shitty a lot but it's not because of them.

And they re-assured me that they want me to come to them about this stuff as much as possible. In the last... almost a year in our relationship they have really 180'd and became such a better partner and I can tell they love me now. I'm extremely content with them.

But I guess I still am terrified of it suddenly snapping back to the time where they told me things like ""I wish you didn't even like me so I could kill myself and not feel guilty about it"" almost every day.

"To be honest, I thought this article was pretty poorly written and argued. The actual advice is perfectly reasonable, and I probably follow 90+% of what deMars advocates. But I find his aversion to the exact phrase ""Good Game"" to be strange.

> ""Good Game"" as a Sports Custom

In this section, deMars lodges a lot of complaints against youth sports, but none of them seem to actually say why ""Good Game"" is so upsetting. The examples of opponents saying ""Bad Game"" or ""You Suck"" and the parents being obnoxious and unsportsmanlike from the stands seem to highlight the need for sportsmanship in competition. They are an example of deviations from the normal script which cause players to feel bad, which is where sticking to ""Good Game"" and good sportsmanship helps boosts both teams' feelings.

Separately, he brings up a Mercy Rule game as a point where ""Good Game"" makes ""comically little sense."" However, I think that this is an example where ""Good Game"" is great: the winners show respect even for an outmatched opponent, and the losers likewise show respect rather than assigning blame or being upset. Maybe deMars disagrees with me, but he doesn't elaborate at all.

> Outgrowing ¡°G.G.¡±

The author then writes a section which basically sums up as: ""Because our parents told us to do this as kids, it has no value as adults and we should move past it."" Rather than explore the motivations that adults have for telling their kids to line up and say ""Good Game,"" deMars rallies against it with such fallacious examples as:

> Not everything we are taught as children remains 100% accurate and applicable when we become more mature and advance into adulthood.

> Can you even imagine if you were still required to believe and practice every single thing you were told when you were six years old?

> ¡°Don¡¯t talk back to adults,¡± is a good example. You¡¯re not going to get far in life if you are never allowed to disagree with an adult¡­

DeMars claims that ""Good Game"" is something that is taught to children which can be abandoned as they grow up and understand more complex examples. And he's right: ""Good Game"" is a starting point for good sportsmanship in general.

In the next section, deMars writes:

> The problem with ¡°good game¡± as a lexical item is that it¡¯s a tilting phrase. When you ¡°G.G¡± somebody after beating them, it can often tilt them. You¡¯ve already won the round. The least you can do is not compound your opponent¡¯s unhappiness by rubbing it in.

"> well I know we learned to pray from the prophet, but the ahlul beyt protected it--from what I understand. 

But who do you know that for sure without the science of hadith on your side? The science of hadith allows you to know which hadith is authentic and which is fabricated or weak etc. It's not enough to turn to a cleric from the hawza and say ""he said it's ok"". 

No doubt, ahlul-bait transmitted some things to us from the prophet, but most of the knowledge we have today came from the sahaba. Aisha for instance was with the prophet and taught us many things, including the way he prayed, among other things. 

> actually there is a huge science of checking hadith, do you know about the hawza, people study there for up to 80ish years. do you think they are flat out stupid?

What year did Shia clerics start? 

Ilmurrijal was started by Shu'bah ibn Al Hajjaj who was born in 83H (1350 years ago), and it grew with other Sunni scholars such as Malik bin Anas and Sufyan Ath-Thowri. This is the science that establishes the authenticity of the hadith. Without it, we have nothing. 

> you learn if it's true first by the quran.

The Quran always comes first, yes, but we can't understand the Qur'an without the hadith. It explains the Quran.

> was it the shia leaders who were infallible(prove to me that they are fallible if you can) or mostly fallible men?

In order for you to say they are infallible, you have to provide proof from Islamic scripture. Our belief is that only prophets are infallible, because of proof from the Quran and Sunnah. They can commit small sins as the Quran has informed us, but not the big ones or kaba'ir.

Is there such proof for the imams? 

> where were all those people when hussein was being opressed? 

Those people tried very hard to keep Husain in Madinah. They told him he would be in trouble if he went there. For example, Abdullah bin Abbas and others worked very hard in trying to convince Husain not to go, but he insisted. No one could convince him, he was very persistent. And when the troubel with Husain happened, no one expected he would be killed, because that was not the intention of Yazid nor the state; it was a decision made by a small ruler who was repsonsible for that area (his name is Obaidillah bin Ziad). When Obaidilliah's men reached Husain they insisted he come with them to Obaidillah, and Hsuain refused. Husain asked them for three options: that they would allow him to go to Yazid in Syria (because he trusted Yazid not to hurt him), or they allow him to turn back to Madinah, or that they would allow him to go to a frontier and do jihad until he dies. They refused all three options and insisted he come with them, and then the battle ensued and he was martyred. There were no large groups of Sunni Muslims around him when this happened, and no one expected these evil men to dare and kill the grandson of the prophet anyway. 

With that being said, I have a question: why do you base your whole religion on these things? Bro, Allah completed Islam and he didn't mention Al Husain or his martyrdom. It was tragic but it's not part of the creed of Muslims. Neither Husain nor Ali were mentioned by name in the Quran. These historical stories should not be part of our religion.

> there are stories where imam ali starved so he could feed needy people, where were the muslims when his son was starved and massacred?

The stories about Husain being starved are incorrect. So many things were added to that story to make it more emotional, but we don't go by emotions; we only go by what can be proven from reputable sources.

"Oh God. Where to start.

Okay. So a long while back, a redditor began a subreddit called ""shit reddit says"" which took quotes redditors said and quotes from storm front (a neonazi site) and had a game where we had to guess which was from which to highlight how sexist, homophobic, racist, etc. reddit is.

This person was irritated towards feminists too, and seemed annoyed when people tried to have discussions about the comments he linked to.

He abandoned his sub, and it was taken over by feminists who maintained and strengthened the rule that you could only circlejerk, not have serious conversations. However, these new people also genuinely cared about the shitty things that reddit says.

Whereas the original guy just did screen shots and created a quiz, the new SRS linked directly to threads and engaged in heated arguments in them, downvoting and calling out racism and other problems with reddit, like transphobia. They stopped the quizzes.

As they got more attention, they became more and more militant. The began branding themselves the fempire, ironically comparing themselves to hitler, seeking massive amounts of drama, and basically encouraging people to think horrible thoughts about feminists.

They began banning everybody who said anything counter to the circle jerk. I was once linked there by subreddit drama. In that thread, someone said we downvote everyone. I said, ""that's not true, some of you had good points. I upvoted. I tend to upvote things with content."" I was banned.

They also preemptively banned people who never even commented.

They also have an inability to distinguish if someone is being racist or if someone is calling out racism.

For example, AndrewSmith1986 said, ""The only reason people call Obama a Muslim is that they can't call him a nigger,"" and was heavily downvoted for the n-word, EVEN THOUGH HE WAS CALLING OUT RACISM. I guess they don't like To Kill A Mockingbird either (although, yes, I admit that book could be problematic for focusing on white people rather than black people).

Anyway, they do equally problematic things. They had a picture of Sagan kissing Degrasse Tyson and sold it on coffee mugs, refusing to admit that it was insulting gay people to use being gay as an insult.

[EDIT: I forgot some of the more sinister stuff. I'll start with less sinister and build up.

First, there were accusations of a take-over by Something Awful. They successfully got reddit to ban anyone who posts suggestive photos of any minor. I am actually in support of this ban but most of reddit didn't seem to be. You can ask nitesmoke below me for a recap of the wild SA take-over.

Second, if you are a minority or a woman or whatever, and they have a viewpoint contrary to you, they call you a special snowflake and insult you. The quote about Muslim and nigger can be rephrased to say, ""The only reason SRS calls someone a special snowflake is that they can't call him an Uncle Tom.""

Game stores are a thing. Easier with a car, but barring that there's public transportation like busses/trains, personal transportation like bicycles, and your two best locomotive friends, left foot and right foot. Plenty game stores run Adventurer's League, if public play is your thing, and you can always try to recruit players you meet into a private game. Even if AL doesn't fit your schedule, just showing up and talking to employees and patrons goes a long way.

Along with game stores, the idea of flyers comes to mind. One of the earliest ways people historically found groups was to advertise, with a little flyer ""Hey I want to do this DnD thing and need people to play with, this is what I want, this is my schedule, call me here"" with phone number rip-off bits at the bottom. Put them up in game stores, or really anywhere else that has cork boards.

And all of that hasn't even delved into the internet. Places like /r/lfg can be used to find in person games. And you can find people to play online with using Roll20 or FantasyGrounds or the archaic but ever classic message board or chat client.

I'm not saying it's easy. All of these things come with hurdles to overcome, especially for people who are introverted or experience mental illness (anxiety in particular) on a significant scale. Not every solution works for every person either, it's much tougher if you're in a particularly rural place, or have no viable transportation, or don't have internet. But there are so many options available that the vast majority of people have something they can do that they haven't done yet.

"Well you're mostly being down voted because a lot of women here can have a BMR of 1500 or below and quite a few shorter men here can have BMR of 1800 or below. Simply throwing out a 1500-2000 number is too generalised and is what FAs do.

I believe some of the women in this subreddit live on 1200/day? and some men 1500. As long as you account for metabolic adaptation, in other words, a decrease in BMR during and after weight loss, then CICO applies and you'll still maintain or lose weight accordingly.

"(forewarning: sorry for the ramble, my hands just kindof spewed this as a flow-of-consciousness deal)

honestly i think this is close, but is a bit constrained a view of functionality of diatonic chords.

(V7->i) is of course a device from the harmonic minor scale (and it's primary cadence), and combined with other tonal minor scales forms the basis of ""minor tonality"" as a whole.

still as you say, V7->i is not a functional resolution of aeolian, however bVII7->i is (V7->vi), and is commonly called the ""deceptive cadence"".

one could say V7->vi is deceptive as it is using the relative dominant, and the primary ""dominant"" of aeolian is actually ii (or iihdim7), and i use the """" as this is really a more subdominant chord, but it functions as a dominant in the way that word is (ab)used due to the tritone.

the primary evocation of a triadic cadence in ionian is well known as IV-V-I, the major sub, major dom (evoking 4-7) and resolving to the major tonic such that the leading tone is contained in the chord directly prior to the tonic resolution (in this case 7 in V).

it's minor equivalent however, is not iv-v-i (well known that the b7 degree in v is weakly resolving to 1, but that's not the true cause) and the V is often (and usually without much more of an explanation that ""because we want a leading tone!"") raised to form a good cadence to i, but this borrows from harmonic minor, is a different scale, and is certainly not native to aeolian, and honestly, is more a sign of the classical overreliance on the V-I meme so heavily used in major.

the minor equivalent of the IV-V-I primary cadence is instead reversed in aeolian: as v-iv-i, such that the triad immediately prior to resolution contains the leading tone: b6 to fall to 5.

Ah! but it falls to 5, not 1, it's not a leading tone (and it goes in the wrong direction!) I won't explain this thoroughly, but the 5th degree of a minor triad is somehow it's ""root"". In a major triad, the top two tones support the root (E and G both belong to C), but in a minor triad, this is reversed. in ACE, C does not support A (C# would, although E does). But instead, both A and C serve to support E. In a similar manner, the iihdim7 (aeolian's counterpart to ionian's V7) is an upside down dom7 chord in the exact same way the minor triad is an upside down major triad.

try playing iihdim7b (second inversion not neccesary, but it puts the 4th degree in the bass for a strong bass resolution) -> i then V7->I. the relative analogy, and plagal/authentic duality between major and minor modes is surprisingly clear on hearing it.

So, at least in aeolian: the plagal cadence is the strongest: exactly the reverse of ionian where the authentic cadence is strongest.

Anyway, after that small digression: I and vi are not the only triads capable of exerting at least some tonic function. iii and IV are also both tonic function in some sense, depending on how they are used. (think v-bVI deceptive cadence in minor), with iii exerting more tonic function with respect to major, and IV with respect to minor, as iii is the primary dominant of minor, and IV the primary subdominant of major, and so those roles are more important in those contexts.

So, at least phrygian and lydian are both capable of supporting a (partial) functional tonic.

this is however not true of mixolydian and dorian as they exert pure dominant and subdominant function respectively.

this is just an extension of the same mechanic that allows one to resolve from V7->vi in major. the vi triad always exerts tonic function, regardless of whether you are in major OR minor, or phrygian, or lydian... i think it's more a question: the type/flavour of tonic function that is felt primary as the home of the tune that determines which you want to go to, and which are stronger.

for example: in a purely major piece that heavily uses the major tonic resolution to become expected, a sudden resolution to vi while at least tonally complete, it somewhat surprising and feels a bit off (hence, deceptive), similarily, one can resolve deceptively in minor to bVI, although that feels somewhat incomplete as it retains its relative subdominant character aswell, you can even treat IV like this in major, if you wanted to describe this by a descriptive name as bVI/vi rather than IV.

there is quite a large amount of functionality (and variable roles) within a single diatonic key with zero chromaticism, and we don't need a chord to be a V7 to be ""dominant"", nor does it need to be rooted on the 5th degree to exert at least some dominant function.

honestly, the only way i know to securely solidify a mode without functionality (and the tonal implications thereof) inherently ""getting in the way"" is to use other techniques, like droning/pedal points etc. the moment the harmony becomes fully dynamic, the functional (and tonal) gravity of the notes themselves inherently start to take hold.

>Functional harmony cadences occur when a dissonant function resolves to tonic.

so, having said all that, my problem with this statement is that functional ""cadences"" as such, are almost impossible to avoid when using any mode of the scale (as honestly, the ""mode"" is irrelevant, simply your resolution target of choice). if you are using dorian, and invoke a B containing chord, then the dorian tonic, which contains F, you have just invoked the sub/dominant functional dissonance, and it is awaiting resolution and if you follow that dorian tonic with ANY triad containing C and or E, it will sound more functionally resolved than Dm did.

"Well, since Buddhism in general is a hard path, I don't see anything strange about the majority of members quitting, and I don't really think that says much about the practice either way.

And of COURSE you can achieve your goals and determinations without Nichiren Buddhism. I don't think anything is a one size fits all--it is just an ""expedient means"" that suits some people and not others--there are many expedient means, and many different paths to enlightenment. 

And as for positive visualization making you more likely to fail--well... both yes and no, depending on how the visualization is done. When you engage in pure positive visualization and just bask in the glow of your imagined future success, and leave it at that--yes, you are absolutely right, studies have shown that this can be counterproductive. The scientific explanation I read is that your mind/body, on the most basic level, can't tell the difference between an imagined experience and a real experience. When you actually achieve a goal, your body releases a little hit of dopamine, which leads to the pleasurable feelings of reward. When you just visualize achieving the goal then, you still get that little hit of dopamine, and get some of that positive feeling of reward--but without actually doing the work. Because you already got some of the reward you were seeking, but without having to expend effort, this leaves you less motivated to achieve than before. (This is a super over-simplified explanation). BUT, if you visualize yourself achieving your goal and then make sure to CONTRAST it to the undesirable situation of the way things are now, it causes this hit of dopamine to then be countered by the chemicals that produce more negative feelings. What happens then, is that you associate achieving your goal with the feeling of pleasure, but you are immediately reminded of your dissatisfaction with the current state of things. This mental contrast, as opposed to pure positive visualization, has been shown to INCREASE motivation and effectiveness. (This research was cited in the book The Procrastination Equation, which was a recent, popular book by a research psychologist on the subject of defeating procrastination. It delved into areas like increasing motivation and willpower, how to effectively change habits, how to get yourself to work effectively towards achieving your goals, etc.--and it presented research to back up the strategies it recommended. 

As for the practical benefits of mindfulness in increasing happiness, helping to modulate emotions, improving ""distress tolerance"" (the ability to withstand very painful negative emotions without resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms like escapism, regression, denial, etc.). Mindfulness (which is usually practiced/rehearsed by regular practice of various meditation techniques) seems to be of value in improving overall life effectiveness, see research on Dialectical Behavioral Therapy and Mindfulness Based Therapy--two newer forms of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy that are considered to be ""Evidence Based Treatments"" (meaning they have science to back their effectiveness). As chanting a mantra is an established meditative technique in MANY religions and philosophies, I don't see how chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo would not have the same benefits that other forms of meditation seem to provide. Research suggests that regular meditation slows cognitive decline, increases neuroplasticity reduces stress, and reduces the symptoms of depression and anxiety, among other positive benefits. If for nothing else than THAT, the practice would have a positive effect.

I also don't see how a philosophy that has you take responsibility for yourself and for the consequences of your own actions is a negative one?And as I mentioned before, having this ""inner locus of control""--is believed to reduce levels of depression, and increase your likelihood of achieving your goals. (There is extensive research on this, too--it is one of those concepts that is included in just about every psych textbook.)

I am genuinely curious as to why you are so negative about the SGI? Look, I'm not pushing the religion. I honestly don't care if others practice or not-- to each his own--...

I mean, I was raised Catholic. Catholicism isn't for me, but my mother is quite devout, and more power to her if it makes her happy,,,I feel the same way about Nichiren Buddhism and the SGI

I am curious as to what harm the SGI did to you, and how the religion hurt you so much that you feel compelled to denounce it and be a ""whistleblower""?

BTW--studies show that 95% of people who join AA quit as well, but for the 5% of people who stay, it works great. Its kind of one of those ""it works for the people it works for"" situations, and that is how I see the SGI.

I also think that whether the SGI helps you improve your life, or whether it leads to self-delusion, ineffectiveness and stagnation, largely depends on your mindset and how you interpret the philosophy--and also on whether you actually put the teachings into action or you just passively expect chanting alone to fix everything...basically, I think it comes down to whether you walk the walk or just talk the talk

Like, I have this friend in the practice who chants for a couple hours a day, and has done so for 20 years, and he was just complaining to me recently, not understanding why he wasn't getting any benefits, wondering why his life sucked so much...the thing is, he chants a lot, but he taes NO positive action. He makes bad causes constantly, creating terrible consequences for himself. If you aren't even going to try to LIVE by the principle that what you do now creates your future, then why in the hell would you bother chanting ""devotion to the mystical law of Karma"" over and over again?

"That's not making anything up, that's me speaking(albeit a little subjectively if you really want to get technical) of how the nature of battle threads are. Next.

Once again, this example that you're giving is still not showing me making anything up. But I will reply to it and explain my reasoning behind the whole ""x>y"" argument. Certain characters can have glaring weaknesses and can lose certain battles for a multitude of reasons. These reasons can make a huge difference in the context of a battle. For example, Kakashi beat Obito, right? Now, does this mean that Kakashi would also beat Guy, Naruto, and Killer Bee combined? No, most likely not. But since Kakashi beat Obito(context is apparently irrelevant here), he should be able to do the same thing that Obito did, right? That's exactly where the problem lies in those kinds of lists. I figure, if a character is so absolutely better than another in you eyes, then why not just argue about it using feats and evidence? If you're so sure Madara would win, why haven't you made a solid argument yet?

DMS Kakashi feats are similarly applicable to Obito, considering that Obito was the reason why Kakashi was able to use the DMS. Everything I argue for DMS Obito, I can support with manga feats and I can in fact thoroughly explain why it's applicable if you so wish, just call me out on whatever it is that you doubt. Now, compare this, to the fact that you have no argument whatsoever concerning Madara. 

Just as you said I'm guessing, you're guessing right here. The truth is, we can't be certain. But tell me why Kamui wouldn't work? Kamui allows the user to phase through objects as shown various times in the manga, why is Amaterasu an exception. If you can explain why it wouldn't work, then I'll concede this argument, but until then, you have nothing. 

Obito doesn't have to be better than Madara at tai, nin, or genjutsu. He only needs Kamui to win, and you still haven't proven that wrong. But even so, Obito is on par with Madara in terms of ninjutsu. I can explain why if you so wish.

First off, Madara can't speed blitz him. A half dead Obito that was being controlled by Black Zetsu was able to block two TSBs, Madara is at most on par with the speed of a TSB or perhaps even slower. As a matter of fact, Obito was faster than Madara in that same chapter as well. Remember when Madara tried to take out his Rinnegan? Obito activated Kamui before he could grab it. Madara cannot speed blitz Obito. And you also seem to keep misunderstanding, Obito is going use Kamui on Madara to kill him. Obito has both eyes, meaning all he has to do is look at Madara for less than a second and the fight's over. 

downgraded shinobi skills don't matter in this fight, I don't know why you're brining them up. We're arguing Madara vs DMS Obito. Nothing else, don't bring up any other hypothetical situations for the fight other than that.

I think that diving into these methods is worth the time at some point. I've done some swimming in this water previously, and will again at a reasonable time for me. My take is that the best alternative voting system is the one we can get, and that holding out for one at the cost of the other is wrongheaded. But that having that discussion at this stage is critical.

I believe it's inherently evident that RV holds the potential to capture more of the voters intent, because instead of capturing a simple order, you are quantifying how potent that order is. 9, 7, 0, holds more info than 1, 2, 3. It includes a magnitude of the ranking. Then the devil is in the details of the 'recount'. This means that it will certainly be possible to find the situation where perfection has not be obtained via IRV/IR. How much concern to give such a scenario is still debatable for me, balanced against other factors.

He implicitly accused her of stealing his data (I have no evidence that she did, but I have no evidence that she didn't) then asked for a third party audit to prove she is innocent. On national TV. So that is when the tone changed.

Myxo Demolisher is still a great weapon for early-mid G-Rank, but Nero and Cera are better. Pretty much every single forum post, discussion, guide and game story, agree on those two weapons.

And look, no trash talking!

EDIT: after reading beyond all that tryhard speech, you are putting a lot of words in my mouth. 

First of all, Slime has a CHANCE to proc with each attack. Of course you CAN have more procs with the right skills, leading to more explosions on certain quests. That's just a statistical fluctuation. Cherry-picking two videos as a proof isn't conclusive at all. Again, I proposed 2-3 blows per quest as a rough estimate for all the grinding I've done with my own Myxo Demolisher.

Second, YOU started talking about speedrunning. Again, speed killing heavily depends on your playstyle, but in GENERAL TERMS (as I said), faster weapons which can exploit idle times, elemental weaknesses and/or status are better for speedrunning than Myxo Demolisher as a solo hunter, specially because monsters build resistance to Slime the more you apply to them. That means less frequent explosions for a weapon with the same damage potential. I proposed Spectral Demolisher as the best Brachydios weapon for this, NOT as the best speedrunning weapon. Also, stop cherry-picking videos over Youtube. Isolated cases aren't proof of a statistical tendency.

Third, Cera Cymmetry needs Crit Draw because the skill adds 100 affinity to your seathed attacks, that means that instead of having a 20% chance of whiffing your Seathed Attack (and considerably lowering your burst damage potential), you have an 80% chance of dealing insane damage with that same seathed attack.

The good thing about all these movements is that it's changing society and women are actually coming forward and talking about their experience now. Men too, boys who were raped are talking about it a lot more. It's doing a lot more good than bad which is why feminists get upset when MRA takes a hostile stance towards things like metoo.

I didn't make any argument. I noted that you're setting the frame for a presumption of materialism, which makes it perhaps too easy to conclude materialism.

>The existence of imaginary numbers is inferred based on the existence of real numbers

The key thing is inferred. Great. They were inferred that way. But they were not observed. The existence of imaginary numbers is not predicated on real numbers existing. One could imagine any number of other routes by which they could be discovered. And they are discovered, not invented.

Likewise, Pi would be an irrational number even if humans had never existed. It's existence is a transcendent truth, knowable through reason, not through observation.

These are objective truths, and truths more certain than any observation of the real world. As I said before, this would be impossible if the truth of mathematical proofs was predicated on observations, as they would be strictly less than or equal to the reliability of the observations.

>You're misapplying your terms.

I'm not the one who said ""Argument from Ignorance"" when one's grounds for an argument were pointed out.

>Its not objectively true in and of itself.

It is. We can demonstrate this with a simple thought experiment about aliens. Math is often thought to be a universal language. When communicating with the stars, we look for things like prime numbers and so forth as a means by which to see an artificial signal. But since their development must be by definition alien to ours, why is it that we expect that we would be able to talk through math?

The answer is that math is discovered, not invented.

> You can be certain of the math, but that doesn't mean the math absolutely applies. You're looking at this problem backwards. 

You're agreeing with me here. We are more certain that 2+2 = 4 than having it apply to the real world.

>You can't know in things outside of the universe because you don't exist there nor can you produce reliable measurements of it. 

...and there's the payoff from the presupposition I called out in my opening paragraph. 

I will absolutely agree with you that if all there is to knowledge is empirical observation, as you imply with your ""reliable measurements"", then we can have no knowledge of things outside the universe.

But as we've seen, this is not actually the case. We can deduce the existence of things outside of the universe, in much the same way that you claimed we can infer imaginary numbers from real numbers!

>Your the one attacking reason based on evidence by purporting indeterminate conjecture as if it constitutes proof
 
Conjecture is not proof. Please do not confuse the two.

If I prove that 2+2 = 4 under, say, ZFC set theory, then I have proven it. It is not conjecture. 

I suppose you might try to dismiss a proof that you don't like as conjecture, but this is an irrational line of attack. If a proof is provided to you, you can attack the premises, or you can attack the line of reasoning. You can't just say that because it's a proof, it is conjecture, as you do here. These are not the same things.

>You can't make claims up from scratch and claim they're valid

Not true. Validity is can be quite easy to demonstrate using terms I just made up:

All A are B. 
All B are C. 
Therefore, all A are C.

Perhaps you meant to say soundness?

>Stating that god is timeless and eternal is not a rational or logical claim in any sense of those terms. 

Is is the conclusion, not an assumption. So this argument doesn't apply.

>And without evidence, neither side can know. 

A logical proof is a form of evidence. And a more certain one than the empirical observations that you seem to be in a monogamous relationship with.

>I'd say its ironic that you, a theist, is trying to re-frame the terms evidence and knowledge in order to purport your fake knowledge

Evidence and knowledge have definitions. Evidence is something that can be used to support a claim. An argument is a claim supported by evidence. Knowledge is a true justified belief(). And so forth.

Nowhere in those definitions does the fine print read, ""...and only reliable measurements are allowed"".

This absurd insistence that a form of evidence, with only modest levels of confidence, is the only form of evidence is not only a logical fallacy you make, but is the cancerous irrationality that lurks at the heart of modern atheism. 

>Logic is not divine providence! If your argument can't stand up on its own merit, then it shouldn't. This quote describes your failure, not mine. There's no reason outside of your cognitive dissonance to believe in an archaic faerie tale. And asserting that as truth or evidence is a blatant lie. The terms you're using mean the exact opposite of how you're applying them. You're actually describing something that theists do, not atheists, to justify their silly beliefs. You're conflating the boundary between words and actions so that anything you feel seems plausible by purporting a mind before matter argument. But that's an egocentric defense mechanism. Just because you need to believe something doesn't make it real. And you've still skirted around the original question refused to support why you think ""god is eternal and timeless,"" actually constitutes knowledge.

I see this as the basis for the cognitive dissonance, and also the reason you are being singled-out and called names (unfortunately).

So subconsciously, people who read your comments defending the technology (which intuitively comes second to their tyrannical business model) assume you have no problem with the company.

Domestically US is slightly better (Americans really need to read up on the sheer massacres of natives, drug testing on minorities, heck you guys claim to be a democracy but the minorities didn't even have the same voting rights till the 60's). I as a non-American don't honestly care about that, much like the rest of the world. We are more concerned with how America behaves with others, and compared to America, Chinese 'aggression' in foreign affairs is nothing. 

I may be in my 20's but I have lived in various countries around the world (inlcluding the US), but I have travelled to various geopolitical conflict zones, and interacted with people from around the world, so I understand the complexity of geopolitics to a large extent. I am not saying the US should completely recede, but an increased Chinese role globally will be better off for many non-Western countries. For much of the developing/emerging world (so majority of the planet) China's tool of foreign policy is money, development & projects. America's tool is invasions, drones, airstrikes. Although, America is still immensely able to exert its soft-power through Hollywood, American clothing brands, food chains etc....but that is changing with regards to China as well. Ten years back 'Made in China' meant some cheap, poorly assembled, knockoff.....now it's hard to find anything that is not made in China, plus China has also given birth to global premium brands.

"> TIL: my Greek professors were wrong when they taught me that ?¦Ä¦Å¦Ë¦Õ¦Ï? is plural of ?¦Ä¦Å¦Ë¦Õ??, meaning brother...

I don't know who taught you Greek, but I think there is a pretty good chance they would be embarrassed to read your comment. Here's what's wrong:

1. Words almost never have a one-to-one overlap in meaning between languages. Brother is the closest English equivalent to the Greek word ?¦Ä¦Å¦Ë¦Õ??, but they are not one-and-the-same. ?¦Ä¦Å¦Ë¦Õ?? also refers to cousins, nephews, etc. 
2. Plurals do not necessarily have the exact same meaning as singulars. This happens it Greek, in Hebrew, and even occasionally in English. Wood refers to the material from a tree, while woods are a small group of trees. Meaning aways comes from usage, not etymology or morphology.

">Sure, but critiquing the PRACTICE is MUCH different from vaguely associating the name with nasty things -- wouldn't you agree?

Please tell me how one would critique the practice then? The Gurus made it clear that in their opinion, a Hindu who did things with devoutness or a Muslim that did things with devoutness, was in agreement with them. They¡¯ve made it clear that they view all humanity as one. It is absolute balderdash to make them have to censor themselves while critiquing practices that were practiced by Hindus and Muslims at the time. Most of the fiercest critiques of Hindus and Muslims found in the Guru Granth Sahib anyway comes from Hindus and Muslim saints themselves. See Kabir¡¯s or Namdev¡¯s writings. Bulleh Shah isn¡¯t in the GGS, but is also a Muslim that primarily criticized it-you guessed it, practices of Muslims! Here in the subreddit, we routinely criticize practices of Sikhs and encourage open discussions on aspects of Sikhi.

Why in the future? What you¡¯re doing is reducing Sikh philosophy to a minimum to avoid any type of critical thinking in the text.

"So, this is the crux of the matter:

""And as a rational person you undoubtedly know how fallible this type of ""evidence"" is.""

There has been a lot of ""science"" over the years that has been accepted as fact and then proven to be completely wrong. The common demoninator in all that bad science has been on thing, people. You have said that God, by definition, cannot exist because he violates the laws of physics. I would say that nothing can exist that defies the laws of physics but the problem is, we don't know what the laws are. 

My favorite current bad science is the assertion that nothing can go faster than the speed of light. While it might be true, my position is that accepting that as fact when we've barely even left our planet is utter nonsense. I'm no scientist, I'm a mechanic so the science on this might be solid and I might be all wet but my logical brain says I'm pretty much on the money. I remember when I was a kid that there was a debate about the makeup of the internal structure of the planet. That might be settled now, I don't know but like with the new spiders, we haven't even figured out everything about the stuff we can phsycially touch yet we're making statements of fact about the laws of the universe? I don't think anyone has really even come up with a good definition of life itself when you can see it everywhere. 

So, this would actually seem to bear out your statements about how hinky personal experiences can be but what I would say is that accepting one guy's opinion on something because he has used some form of science to justify it and dismissing another because he uses faith or simply personal experience is kind of silly. I understand the scientific process but people make a lot of money on a daily basis by fooling a lot of people, hell, it's pretty much how our political system works. 

This is an important point:

""in practice there are some among us who just can't seem to function without a comforting and/or simple superstitious belief. They can't be expected to grasp the complexities of morality, and can't come to terms with things like death on their own.""

I agree with that, it's one of the things religion does and does well. I get a lot of praise for my technical skill but we all have our places and our strengths and weaknesses. I can take the Internet apart and put it back together but if you held a gun to my head and forced me to create a piece of music, I'd be one dead honkey. I don't need any of that stuff but some people do and I don't have a problem with that. Religion is used to justify evil but so is peanut butter, it doesn't mean we're going to be able to get rid of either one or that they aren't important and useful in some cases. What's rational and meaningful to you is hogwash to someone else but how boring would it be if we were all the same.

Do they proclaim themselves to be ""the platform of the alt-right""? Or did you just hear someone else say that about them?

>The cameraman is employed by Breitbart. So yeah, that's a ""sign if political support"".

No it's not, actually. Richard Lewis used to WRITE for Breitbart and wasn't even a fervent right winger, let alone part of ""the alt-right"", let alone a racist nationalist nazi or whatever you think these people are. 

This is a CAMERAMAN. He doesn't even need to have political opinions. His answer to every political question could be him drooling all over himself. You don't need to be politically affiliated with whatever platform you're working for, especially if your work has nothing to do with expressing your beliefs.

>If they're simply open minded and curious, they'd know what they were walking into. Milo is characteristically offensive, and goes out if his way to sell shock value.

Yes, he's a bit edgy. What's your point here? That because he's known to say offensive things, everyone who's aware of that wouldn't go see a talk of his because that's too much for them to handle? I mean, what?

I disagree with Milo on nearly every point of political policy because I'm left-leaning, especially on social issues. Yet I could see myself going to see a talk of his, especially if someone I knew was also attending. Curious how that immediately refutes the implied sentiment that at every Milo talk, the room must be filled with people who think exactly like him. 

>Just as I'm sure you don't care that Breitbart spreads hateful conspiracy theories that lead people to shoot up pizza parlors.

What an incredibly stupid assumption. Why would you think I don't care about that? Even if I were on Breitbarts side of the discussion - and I am absolutely not - I could easily distance myself from that without losing credibility, just like every SJW-type person can rightly distance themselves from the BLM supporter who shot at police officers in Dallas, while still supporting BLM. Let me clarify once more though (because I have a feeling you'll misinterpret even the most tepid defense as an endorsement) that I am more aligned with [insert most left-wing outlet on earth] than I am with Breitbart. It's exactly for that reason that I dislike bad criticism of it, because it makes people like me look stupid. 

No idea what you were going for with that line, but it misfired horribly

>...Milo works for Breitbart. Breitbart is the alt-right.

Already given you an example of someone who worked for Breitbart who doesn't even identify as a right winger so... lol. 

>Go to the alt-right subreddit. They say it's a race movement in the sidebar.

You're making a lot of logical leaps here. I'll spell some out that don't follow:

1. Breitbart ""is"" the alt right, even though they've only been labeled that by outside news sources like CNN. If you look on Wikipedia it says alt-right people typically use websites like ""Breitbart and Twitter"". Although that's undoubtedly true, does that make Twitter an alt-right platform too? What if they personally don't agree with that categorization? How are you going to still tell me they must agree with the sidebar of some subreddit that labels themselves the same thing?

2. Everyone who does identify as being an alt-righter must agree with the definition presented by a subsection of volunteer moderators on reddit.com who consider themselves part of the alt-right. Meanwhile, some people have been told they're part of the ""alt-right"" just because they like Trump more than Hillary and have no idea what reddit even is. 

3. Everyone who is part of a ""race movement"" or even has false racial biases is the kind of evil racist who should be ""afraid"" (that's how this conversation initially started). I agree, people who affiliate themselves with the white power movement, stormfronters, people who unironically say ""14/88"", people who go fight antifa protestors, and everyone in that fringe should be fucking afraid whenever they leave their house. But if you think someone should be ""afraid"" because they're uncomfortable in the presence of black people (DISCLAIMER: yes, this is obviously a harmful and racist thought) even though there's not a malicious bone in their body, then you're a bad person. 

Note also that this isn't a concession that right wingers who like Milo are all ""racists"". If you talk to any social justice activist worth their salt they will tell you that every single person including themselves has implicit racial biases. These can't really be ""avoided"" when you live in a society that is allegedly racist. Thus the moral high horse of the people like you who try to label others ""racist"" is in jeopardy. It's not enough to demonstrate that someone prefers spending time with someone of their own race 0.001% more than they do spending time with someone of another race. This is everyone, ostensibly, including SJWs themselves, and including you. In order to demonize someone for being a ""racist"" to the extent where they should be ""afraid"", they have to hold malicious, hateful beliefs in one form or another, and you haven't even come CLOSE to demonstrating that you can so comfortably assume that everyone at a Milo talk is this type of racist, that you might as well be able to assault them on the spot.

I wouldn't completely dismiss it just because they haven't cited their source straight away, because they have demonstrated to me in the past (I've read his books) that they take an objective approach to the study of their subject.

In the mean time if I was really interested in the claims made which haven't been cited, as you seem to portray yourself as being as you want to see the data to back up what is being written, I would hit up Google Scholar to see what the peer reviewed literature on the subject has to say (let me know what you find, I'd be interested whilst waiting for Daves more in-depth post).

"Actually, yes. The concept of patriarchy doesn't say that ""all women are victims"" and ""all men are predators."" It says that society manufactures genders stereotypes that disenfranchise people based on their gender.

Yes, most often we hear about how the patriarchy leads to things like sexual harassment against women (because society treats women like sex objects), or women being discounted in the workforce (because men are supposed to be the bread winners, and women stay home and have babies). But there are other sides to it, too.

For example, if a man has ever been told that his interests are too feminine, that's the patriarchy pushing a role on him. If a man has ever been told to ""man up,"" that's the patriarchy assuming that only women can be emotional, and, therefore, it's wrong for a man to show emotion. The patriarchy cuts both ways.

The patriarchy disenfranchises women by implying they're meant primarily for motherhood. But it also disenfranchises men for implying they're only meant to make money for their wives and children. Just like the patriarchy makes it hard for women to be in the workforce, it makes it hard for men to be stay-at-home dads.

In this case, because society insists that men are always dominant and interested in sex, these boys aren't being viewed like the victims they are. Because attractive women ""should"" be sex objects, this woman isn't being treated like the pervert she is.

"> I'm not sure that anyone is being forced to sell products or provide services against their will? 

I agree, I was just using that as an example. When the whole ""bakery owner refuses to sell cake to gay couple"" story popped up a few years ago, people were rightly outraged, but supporters of the bakery owner piped up with arguments that the only other alternative would be to force that bakery owner to make the cake for that gay couple instead, and I was saying that, bigotry aside, I begrudgingly admit that people should maintain a right to discriminate as they so choose. I just think that when that discrimination intersects with the public in a certain way, it shouldn't be given automatic deference.

> First and foremost, that the bigots in question would be on board for this ""compromise""...Given this, it is unlikely in the extreme that anyone would agree to such an arrangement.

I agree - at this point in time. I'm just arguing from more of a theoretical viewpoint of whether or not there could be a case made for this. I've likened this situation a little bit to the EPA - it was obviously unlikely that many people would get on board with a restriction on certain practices (pollution), but society deemed the issue to be of particular importance, so they acted. I think the public opinion on sexual orientation is drifting towards establishing it as a protected class, and I feel like it certainly will be within the near future. I'm suggesting that once it does get to that point, it would seem prudent and fair to incentivize non-discrimination in such a way, since some people are effectively subsidizing a business they can't shop at. 

Also, while I understand your apprehension at how willing the population would be to accept this as a standard, I'm curious how you view similar acts - like the illegality of discrimination in workplaces.

>She was strongly against marriage equality right up until it was politically impossible for her to be.

I was politically aware over most of that period - and went from expressing homophobia as a teen, to realizing it for the poison it was and then condemning it, around the same time - so from my perspective, the switch from ""political suicide"" to ""politically normal"" happened pretty fast. The way I remember it, and I might be wrong, was that the Clintons came into office pushing for gays serving openly, got throttled, tried to compromise with DADT, and then then Gingrich pushed a veto-proof DOMA across his desk. In 2000, I remember being shocked that Hillary was pro-civil unions (which led to a pretty difficult discussion with a few of my dorm-mates who were kind enough to explain the facts of life to me). Then, in 2006, she advocated for states allowing marriage equality. In short, she wasn't at the bleeding edge, but at worst, she stayed out of the way, and at best, she was an advocate. Considering that's about how long it took myself and a good portion of my cohort (much less older folks) to do the same, I can't bring myself to hold that against her.

>She called young black men ""super predators that need to be brought to heel.

Vile comment, and in support of vile legislation. Mind you, crime was destroying us (i.e. NYC, other cities), and - what I've read and had explained to me - the policy was advocated by multiple stakeholders, including representatives of black communities from multiple cities. 

But... that doesn't make it right. Moreover, once it went on the books, it stayed on, long, long after it should have been repealed and denigrated as the vicious, profit-driven, industrialized brutality that it became. She did admit to all this, and did work to fix what damage was possible to fix, but that doesn't heal a fucking thing when it comes to the lives destroyed by the 90's backlash against the crack/lead epidemic. The 1994 Crime Bill was just bad. Mind you, look at who, and how many folks voted for it. It'll help illustrate how fucked political thinking had gotten at the time.

>She backtracked on supporting single payer after insurance companies paid her to give a speech at one of their events.

I thought she backtracked in the 90's after the insurance companies and Gingrich handed the Clinton administration their own asses. It's been a rocky road, and there have been setbacks, but both Clintons have pushed it over the years. If she was President, we might not have gotten all the way to universal single-payer, but at least we'd be closer to it.

Are you implying housing is a right that should be afforded by a government? Are you saying that the have's have a responsibility beyond basic civic duty to the have not's? And that this transfer should occur under the authority of a governing body? This is not equal.

I've never met anyone who does this. If these people do this, they are likely not investors at all as the tax decrease is proportional to the value of the home. So that leaves me to believe that the people to whom you are claiming to ""root"" for their property taxes to go down are very likely low income families.

What makes it difficult with biology is that it's difficult to make proofs while in maths you start with propositional calculus for instance.

Those are not substantive, or point-relevant. Those are personally directed insinuations that discredit, not address a point.

You brought down the dialogue, and if that's the kind of conversation you wanna have, find your emotional validation somewhere else. You've made me way less interested in continuing this conversation.

Feminists are not a gestalt hive mind.

That's... actually black and white thinking.

You do not represent every Men's Rights activist ever. You can claim you speak for them, you can advocate an idea that is one of the proposed core ideas of the ideology. Sure.

But you will never ever be every Men's Rights activist ever. And there will be MRA's with different viewpoints and positions than you. Social movements are inherently somewhat nebulous.

And trying to make it personal instead of substantive widens the gap and muddies the waters.

You wanna judge Feminism on it's outcomes. But Feminism is not a political organization. It is a social movement. It is decentralized and people can claim to align themselves with it by word alone. You could make the argument it's a sentiment more than it's a political organization. 

And any movement that ever came to achieve anything, never was a gestalt hive mind.

>Also feminism tends to exploit, reinforce, and create new female advantages.

>That¡¯s not what I see when I look at the outcomes of feminism.

>Society is also an umbrella that people with different positions and priorities fall under, but that doesn¡¯t stop feminists analysing the whole thing as a social system of Patriarchy based on its overall outcomes as feminists see it. Likewise, although feminism is not a monolith, I can still analyse feminism as a social system based on its overall outcomes. And the overall outcome that I see coming from feminism is fighting female disadvantage while reinforcing male advantage.

Your use of ""Feminism""? That's actually black and white thinking. I would be astounded if you agreed with me here, or didn't immediately get defensive, so I'm fine with preemptively agreeing to disagree.

And either way, that is a tangent away from the content of our conversation. I am not interested in attempting to discredit any of your points with a strawman, but you should probably be aware for your own benefit, that is actually very black and white thinking.

Think about it?

>If you said that it is all part of the traditional gender system you would be closer to the mark, but that still fails to recognize that feminism has reinforced traditional male disadvantages and in some cases created new ones. For example, traditionally the father had child custody privilege and the responsibility of providing for the children. Beginning in the 19th century, feminists shifted custody privilege to the mother (but kept in place the father¡¯s responsibility to provide child support). Now feminists blame female custody privilege on the traditional system, when in reality it was put in place by feminists.

>So blaming everything on ¡°patriarchy¡± denies the agency of women in shaping the traditional gender system, and denies the agency of feminists in reshaping the traditional system into today¡¯s feminist gender system. I see you¡¯re trying to avoid doing that in your post, but the very word ¡°patriarchy¡± carries that connotation.

Can you really take your own statement seriously here?

In the 19th Century?

In the 1800s?

In the United States, women did not yet have the right to work or vote.

The legal status of women was not equal to men and society was radically different. 

In your other reply to my other post, you talked about Feminists interpreting anomalous data however they liked.

"Here's the thing: You can't usually point to good decisions during the time period they're made, because most really good decisions are long-term ones, which don't have their benefits front loaded.

That's kind of the point everyone here is making, isn't it? That the right decisions seem poor or bad at the time, but either are good long-term on their own merits, or the move the needle/conversation to where the big issues are eventually addressed.

For example, Trump's canceling DACA seems like a bad idea to progressives short-term, but it will actually force the issue to get addressed. The alternative was really Dreamers being left in limbo - possibly for years - had Trump done nothing and allowed the status quo to continue.

There is a similar argument related to the tax cuts, which is seen by the fact Democrats have already changed their tune on it - initially, they said the whole idea was bad, afterwords, and after seeing polling returns and seeing how businesses and the economy are already reacting, they changed to ""well, they aren't big enough/permanent/give too much to big corporations"". But the truth is that our tax system is/was LOOOONG overdue for changes, and still needs more changes, but this is at least a step.

Another one which is less what Trump has done and more a result of him being elected: Libertarians have talked for years about the dangers of too much executive power (the dreaded ""Imperial Presidency"" that really came into its prime with Bush and grew with Obama), but neither side really cared. Neocons liked that Bush could make boom-boom on the other side of the world, and Democrats thought that the White House was going to be Blue from now on. No one cared about the power of the Presidency...

...until Trump became President and started with his Executive Orders. Now we have liberal courts supporting the idea of States' Rights!

.

But, again, the point is that things that are objectively great are very very difficult to really say in the moment, because in the moment, emotions are too charged and ideology is too powerful. We can all look back at, say, Bush Sr raising taxes and say, NOW, nearly 30 years later, that it was a good idea...

...but who, AT THE TIME, would have said or agreed to that? Not many.

Indeed, all the things I listed above that have happened under Trump you likely oppose right now, because emotion and ideology. But 20 years from now, you might look at those things and go ""Oh yeah, I could see those things not being all bad.""

So no one is going to be able to convince you, right now, that Trump has made or is making good decisions. You either think that already or you don't. It'll be this way for you for a decade or two, just like it will for everyone else.

This is probably the worst dialogue ever written that I can recall. First I've never heard anyone in any context refer to someone as ""the fag man."" Someone that thought that way would just call them ""a fag."" The dead character is overweight, so we can assume that the illustrious Troy Duffy wrote this backwards, unnatural pun just to establish that Dafoe's character is gay by using a derogatory word.

Yes? Did they fight each other with militaries? 

>There were plenty of treaties they followed that called for them to disarm and they did, and they suffered all the more for it.

Well, first of all: You mean the countries of the EU who are currently living in the most peaceful period of their history by abandoning their national borders and downsizing their militaries?

Secondly: Disarming too far below other nations quite obviously is not what I'm talking about. It's a gradual process.

>A show like that needs to know exactly what it wants to be, because every little thing comes to play later on

I don't know what to tell you, this.... is simply untrue. A story can have complicated and fascinating world building without planning out everything from the beginning. Rick and Morty for example is a good example of this. I HIGHLY doubt that Harmon and Roiland had every piece of plot points and world building mapped out from the very beginning. And yet the show still manages to explore many fascinating worlds many of which has their own sets of culture and laws.

Just because a story started out simple, doesn't mean it can't build an interesting world later on.

>Star Vs. doesn't do that, you can easily tell by how they introduced the concept of Star's wand using batteries, yet never brought it up again.

And yet 2 seasons in we are now exploring the magic realm within the wand and even the the magic realm where the source of magic come from.

Star vs is obviously a show that is susceptible to change. It may have started out episodic with little to no direction, but now we have dimensions to explore, kingdoms with its own culture and social difference between races on Mewni. Clearly the writers want to build a world here. If not they wouldn't have spent time meticulously mapping out the world of Mewni and coming up with creatures like centaurs, mermaids, etc. All of which can be found in the Mastering all Dimension book.

>but given that they spent the better part of two seasons on earth, the chances of them truly building up on that are freaking small.

>it is simply not their time to shine or to introduce them to the great scope of things.

Fine, then. If that's the case then please do tell me what the purpose of episodes like Pizza Thing was? Pony Head's character arc has already been resolved in St. Olga's.

And if the answer is that the episode serves as a slice of life filler then I'm afraid I've got some bad news for you. Like I said in my post, ""need is a strong word, we need doorstops but a brick would suffice."" We don't need the episode Pizza Thing, because we already have plenty of other slice of life filler that would serve the same purpose if not do a better job.

>It's the same with Jackie. Chances are whatever plot line they are planning on following with her is going to involve Star's relationship with Marco, and they couldn't begin to explore that before Star confessed, and that needed time to happen as well.

"slightly left leaning independent disclaimer

This is one thing that conservatives have as a legitimate concern IMO. I am in an industry where I have the opportunity to many different companies and see a lot of different industries on a very intimate level. We do contract work for these companies.

 Not always, but VERY often we bring in new employees that outperform union workers that make twice as much and we do it with about 30% less employees.

I have seen some crazy things....union members sleeping, drinking, stealing, etc and often not even making much effort to hide it because their supervisors won't bother to discipline them because it would get overturned anyway.

The most experienced people get to bid into jobs before less experienced people. So what happens is you have your most experienced people pushing a broom around making $32/hr.

Then it gets worse. If you need additional personnel for manufacturing, you have to offer overtime in order of seniority. So if you want to bring in an assembly line worker on a Saturday, you have to bring in 5 broom pushers, maintenance men, etc just to get to the 1 guy you need. And of course those 5 guys don't have anything to do, so they just sleep or hide somewhere playing cards. And all of this is just accepted. BTW, if you ask them to do something else, they will file a grievance because it's not in their job description (that they bid into).


I am a corporate trainer. I am what many consider ""new age manager"". I teach managers to behave ethically, to utilize two way communication to truly engage employees, etc. So I am all for fairness in the workplace and worker rights.

But with that said...more often than not, unions are bad for everyone involved. They are bad for the business, they are bad for the employee, and they are bad for quality. Union workers are usually so focused on the company being their adversary that they have a hatred for the organization. As a result, they don't truly engage or develop as they should and it hurts their career.

Typically when a union factory goes out of business, most of the employees struggle to find work they are qulified for in the real world. And when they find something, either they are paid much less, or they have to work much harder. ",0

"Your problem here, as I have tried to point out to you before, is that you are constructing a strawman about what feminism is. I have never heard of the site everdayfeminism, but I am relatively confident that they don't speak for all feminists. 

You are selectively picking what feminists you want to acknowledge, and then parade around in triumphant when you find they support your conclusion. There are better approaches than the strawman you constructed.

For instance, feminists and their organizations have overwhelmingly supported certain politicians. Given that it is unlikely feminists would roundly support a politician if they were not upholding the communities views, it's fair to say that we can take the views of politicians feminists roundly support as a proxy for the views of feminists. At the very least, we can say that the views of politicians feminists roundly support are a better better proxy for the views of feminists than a website you found. 

Now, you claim that I haven't given you a single instance of a western feminist denouncing how women are treated in Muslim countries. This is an odd claim considering that I have. Again, Barack Obama, a self-identified feminist who was roundly supported by feminists, not only condemned the treatment of women in Muslim countries, but started the campaign against ISIS - even, in part, defending military action on the grounds that ISIS was brutalizing women. If you would like another contemporary example you can look at Hillary Clinton. Clinton famously said, ""women's rights are human rights"" in China, a line that was intended, and taken, as an attack on the sexists policies of the Chinese government and oppressive countries the world over. There are many more example, but I'll stop here.

The evidence suggests that your assertion is incorrect. It is simply the case that feminist elect people to office who show great concern for women in oppressive countries. So, there goes the first part of your argument. 

\> I can't believe anyone would seriously doubt that the vast majority of feminist activists focus on issues that primarily concern women in the West. You also seem to defend this as morally permissible - so are they not doing it, or are they doing it but it's okay? Pick one. 

Your confusion here is that I have some obligation to defend either position. I'll I need to do is present counter arguments to your idea that if feminists cared about justice, then they should spend more energy focusing on women in more oppressive countries. 

There are several good arguments against this idea. One is that feminists already spend a significant portion of their political energy supporting women in the developing world. This has been demonstrated above. 

Another counter-argument is to say that you can care about justice without spending any of your time supporting women in the developing world. This is fairly easy to defend. There are no social groups in the US that do not have it better than some relevantly similar social group in another part of the world. This has been true since at least the end of WW2, if not before then. Thus, if you want to defend your argument, you must either 1) bite the bullet and say that no political or social movement in the US should be concerned with our affairs, and instead concern themselves with only their worse off peers in the developing world - this includes the civil rights movement, or 2) provide some insight into why feminism is uniquely responsible to take on this task. 

You have failed to do either, and thus have not made a convincing argument.

Even that's an absurd oversimplification, because there's so much fucking history and variables contributing to the colossal clusterfuck that is the Middle East, but learning about stuff is hard, and we know a lot of Western Europe and America (let's just say NATO or America because it's hard to think about stuff when assigning blame) has had their fingers in the Middle East and caused at least some of the strife with the way they've supported certain regimes and aided the overthrow of others in different countries, so let's just say instead that NATO is to blame for everything in the Middle East.

"I was not advocating all of the teachings of Augustine or Aquinas, merely stating that they understood the difference between fact and truth. Also, you are taking both of them out of their historical contexts and placing them into the world of today where antisemitism is generally perceived as being an evil. Similarly, just because you have negative feelings towards the Catholic church does not mean that the institution is a criminal organization. A lot of evil has been done in its name, but since its beginning it has also been doing good. Just as the United States is responsible for both good and evil, writing it off as a criminal organization would disregard the good that it has done throughout history.

You ask how can I presume that I am right about my current thought, in the same manner, how do we know that psychologists, physicists, literary analysts, etc., are right about there thought today? Theology is just as valid of a institutional field of study as any of those, and through this scholarship, a more accurate interpretation and understanding of its content is achieved. Now are my views the final say on the Christian tradition? No, just as scientific thought today will eventually be seen as being antiquated, so will current Theological thought. However, as Theology progresses, it will definitely build upon the ideas in use today.

In regard to your point concerning slavery and violence, when looking at its historical context, the Hebrew culture promoting slavery and violence was hundreds of years ahead of its time in terms of human rights. If you do a study on slavery within the Hebrew nation versus the study of other nations in the Ancient Near East, you will quickly see that the Hebrews were downright humanitarian. Also, the condoning of slavery was not the final word of the Hebrew scripture, rather as the society progressed, slavery eventually became condemned. In order to see and understand this, a person must be very familiar with the meta-narrative of the Old Testament and the history of its development.

Finally, by saying that you would not act in a certain way if you were God, is providing an anthropomorphic version of God. God is not human any more than you are God, and attributing human motives to God is mistaking the fundamental nature of God as being finite.

He still burns people alive.

>It's because she was burning Drogo as well, since that's the Dothraki ritual. Dany didn't know the dragons would come out, she just had an intuition and entered the pyre

MMD was meant to be used as a blood sacrifice, that is why she was equally tied up with Drogo's pyre. She didn't just randomly decide to enter the flames in the middle of the burning. Instead, her actions were planned.

>Dany is not that dumb, she knows of the value of Barristan and that he is loyal right now

She still believed that he betrayed her and her brother, yet she gave him the chance to make amends and he succeeded in that role and was sincere. 

>It isn't close to what she did to MMD and her followe in the series, she had no reason to keep them alive

MMD wasn't a close companion that Dany had traveled with for a long time, moreover she betrayed her in a worse way and her death was meant to play a specific role.

>Wrong, in the series one of her handmaidens betrays her while in the books one of them sexes her up...how is that similar?

She shows a similar amount of companionship with her handmaidens as she does Jorah.

>The burning of Harrenhall wasn't just a big ass execution? Harren just had no way to fight back

The burning of Harrenhall was a battle, thus fact that Aegon's weapon was more effective doesn't make it an execution. Hiroshima couldn't defend itself from the atom bomb, but that doesn't make that an execution. 

>They had dragons they used to their benefit, I don't blame them for it but it was merely an one sided fight, a pure execution of the enemy forces until Dorne fought back

You disprove your own point by mentioning how there were means to fight back against the dragons, just because Harren the Black failed at his attempt doesn't negate that fact.

>lol. seriously? Then the decapited guy will still be alive in the end right?

He might be dead, but his death was relatively quick and easy rather than slow and torturous.

>Advocating for a clean death in westeros lmao

Hardly funny, we see that Westeros has no problem outlawing flaying thus it isn't like they are cool with everything.

>The traitor suffers before dying as an additional punishment, don't see a problem with this,

It is an utter sick and disgusting action, that fact that Stannis allows that shit is a great negative to his character with him acting unjust. 

>I'm not defending anything, I'm just saying that his method isn't the worse one out there in Westeros which is true

You are absolutely attempting to justify it by pretending it isn't a big deal and saying ""Well, Ramsay is worse"" like that is a defense.

>killing innocents, killing traitos...yeah such a slight change

Much less of a change than just making up scenes. Simply, Stannis has already burnt people alive who merely refused to go along with burning the symbols of their faith. 

>Anyway you're the one trying to change the goalpost, our discussion wasn't about STannis method in the first place, it was how this method was applied int he books and in the show

No, my point is that Stannis' actions are absolutely wrong and both cases for the fact of the method he employs. I also said I hardly see it worse if the reason he uses his method is because he actually believes in it rather than him doing it all for show.

>in teh books he kills traitors coming close to cross the line one time , in the show he kills innocent people without any regard

Traitors in the sense that they oppose Stannis' objectives, not because they have been found guilty in any trial (including his own brother).

>Cool, I don't share your opnion regarding Dany but I share your regarding Dany, I didn't know Dany and Stannis scenes were so linked for you that by not considering one you automatically doesn't consider the other though

Because it ridiculous to say one is some horrible change when it is a vastly less of change than just fabricating scenes. Stannis performs his crimes repeatedly in the books and shows zero remorse while Dany doesn't do any of hers.



>And I already talked about Dany scenes, all of them have a scene compatible with them in the books. 

Only they don't, they are completely made up scenes with no connection to anything happened in the book. Stannis' actions are vastly more compatible.

>Dany sentencing her follower to death mirrors what she did to MMD, Dany killing a noble in S5 mirrors her torturing of the shopkeeper in DWD and so on.

False, she had much more reasons for why she executed MMD than she did her handmaiden. Torture while messed up morally (Stannis does it also), isn't the same as brutally killing some random person. The Wineseller actually had a connection with some deaths of her Unsullied while that guy had none that the show tells us of. Furthermore, that ordering of sharp questioning came after it being recommended to her by Shavepate before and made in a heated moment. While, the show's actions was cool and calculated move not recommended by anyone and in fact conflicts with her beliefs in episode almost immediately before that one.

>It does, unlike Stannis whose attitude towards burnings completely changed in teh series, Dany's attitude wasn't changed so much compared to the books

Yeah, Stannis' opinion sure has changed in ASOS he burns people to please a religion he doesn't believe in, in the beginning of ADWD he burns people to please a religion he doesn't believe in, and at the end of ADWD he burns people to please he doesn't believe in. What an amazing change of absolutely nothing.

In contrast, to Dany's lack change of where she doesn't do any of that stuff thus she can hardly change her opinion on that matter. Though, we do know that she allows two individuals she believed to betray her have the chance to redeem themselves.

>Yet you clearly said he was more blackened compared to the book version

Yes, because I am being objective and recognizing some stuff was darkened while other stuff was lightened. 

>You can call it that but it's better than burning innocents

Something Stannis wasn't far off from doing in the books, heck Jon feared that he was going to burn an old man and a baby so much that he was forced to take drastic action.

>Anyway, burning people for some religion you believe is what Vic does, Stannis is doing it as a method of execution you can call it cruel as muc as you want (while truthfully every death is cruel) at least it's better than burning innocents

Both are utterly horrible, and they are more similar to each other than just made up scenes with no connection to the books.

>Not just wants, he is ""begging"" for sex which completely makes no sense if you take book Stannis into account 

It doesn't conflict with anything about book:Stannis, we know that after BW he was desperate and we know they have sex. It is hardly a massive change, instead shows some of Stannis' weaknesses.

"There are many ways to be Buddhist. The Mahayana schools are all about the use of skillful means to bring as many beings as possible to awakening. Recitation of the names of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas can be a more accessible means of practice for people who were/are not inclined to more ""silent"" traditions, or who don't have the means. 


Also, nearly every Buddhist tradition takes for granted the concept of merit transference, even Theravada and Zen, and the most supreme merit in Pureland thought is the light of compassion from Amitabha Buddha's compassionate vows to guide beings to enlightenment who might otherwise would not get a chance to do so, at least not until several lifetimes later. Availing ourselves to our teacher's, Shakyamuni Buddha, call and trusting in Amitabha's vows is analogous to non-calculating thought in any other contemplative practice, with just a different focus.


You will find that there are different schools of Buddhism with almost contrasting methods, and Buddhism isn't a ""one way"" religion, so that's okay. But I will also point out that this contrast between Zen/Theravada and Pureland practice is often exaggerated. Like I mentioned in another post, Ch'an and Thien, the Chinese and Vietnamese equivalents to Zen, respectively, combine sitting practice with Amitabha recitation.

There is, but they are connected in my mind. In the mind of a slut, love and sex are sadly viewed as mutually exclusive. This is a matter of not being on the same page. We're not compatible.

[3] Why do you feel so possessive about women? I enjoy art that millions have people have enjoyed before. I like my friends who have lots of other friends. I don't understand why someone/thing having been enjoyed by others makes it less enjoyable for you. Did you share well as a child? :P

This isn't possessiveness. It's hard to say that it is when I'm telling you I want nothing to do with them. Purity is attractive to me. Women who have respect for themselves are attractive to me. Women who don't separate love from sex, are attractive to me. Sluts, while physically attractive, I view as void of personal integrity, which is a big turn off.

Let me put it to you like this: Art is statically appealing and can be both enjoyed and loved by millions without consequence because it grows in value the more people who indulge in its many wonders. Art that is loved by the many becomes part of culture, and that connection enriches all of their lives. Women are not statically appealing. In fact, after reaching peek beauty in their teens, they are all on a steady decline to having zero sexual value. While they are young, they are sought after by men from around the world, and when they fuck a lot of them, they are enjoyed and loved only temporarily. Unless of course if she becomes famous for her slutiness on a reality television show aimed at the lowest common denominator of viewers, then she can be culturally relevant for fifteen minutes to dipshits. (Porn could potentially have more lasting appeal if she's attractive enough.) However, a slut ceases to be a source of enrichment to your life the moment she moves from you to the next cock. Meaningless sex is instantly gratifying in the moment but ultimately has zero lasting effects. The more sex a woman has, the more worn she becomes. The more experienced, the more jaded, the less sexually curious and the more familiar she appears with the act, the less compelling she is as a person because it's apparent she has slept with many people before.

>but lets look at them anyway, the masturbation one you may think shows women don't enjoy sex, when really it shows that women, in general, are arroused in a different way. Women are more reactionary than men in their sex drives. This means that they may not want sex with every random hot guy they see, but when they want it they want it a lot. There are some reasons for this that have nothing to do with the sex drive. One study found that men and women would accept (at a similar rate) a hookup with a person they had never met, if it was deemed a ""safe"" decision, as in someone had vetted the guy previously.

Can we actually take a look at that? Because it's my experience that studies often use politically correct language to mask politically incorrect findings. Like that one study that said women's sexuality is more ""fluid"", but when you actually sit down to read it, it just says women find more excuses to not to have sex or not enjoy sex.

>As in women like sex, they just like sex in relationships more (at least in general). That goes back to what I said originally, in that women have sex drives, they just don't find every single guy attractive enough to have sex. Looks aren't always enough for a woman. I know for sure they aren't enough for me, I need to know the guy is safe and has a decent enough personality. This was proven in the study I just shared where if they knew the guy was decent, they would be more willing to have a ONS.

I think what he said does do exactly that. Here's the formula:

1. The claim is made that strong gun control laws cause reductions in crime rates.

2. The example is offered of a place where strong gun control laws haven't reduced crime rates.

3. That example is offered in the form of an analogous argument to the contrary, demonstrating how it doesn't work logically.

"It's laughable what is considered ""experienced"" these days, you pass yourself off as experienced while saying garbage like ""the DPS check is tight..."" and ""some mechanics are pure RNG"". The first point is utter non-sense while the second point has some credibility which i will elaborate on below.

For starters the dps check is not tight at all, regular pug groups beat bosses, even gorseval, with minutes to spare on average. Multiple guilds have shown 6 man no updrafts and 10 man no updraft gorseval is common place now. My guild regularly sells raids with 8 people and we never hit enrage timer. Ample evidence against this point out there that it's really a waste of my time to elaborate further.

On your point about RNG behind some mechanics, sure there is RNG behind who has to deal with some mechanics throughout a certain fight (Slothasor fixate, matthias corruption etc) but the mechanic itself is CONSISTENT (e.g whoever gets the slothasor fixate will be temporary tank). This forces EVERYONE in your group to know the mechanic and to PAY ATTENTION, which again falls under PERSONAL SKILL. There is no ""luck"" associated with dropping a poison bomb on the group on slothasor, there's only ""Oh i didn't pay attention and pressed my special action key for no reason and dropped it on the group"".

>Movements (feminism)

Yes, feminism favours and promotes women - as equal to men, as persons in their own right, and its traditional focus has been in examining gender disparities while trying to erode them through legal measures and social change. You're right that feminism doesn't focus as heavily on men, and I think this, in large part, has been about the lack of male feminists, and also the optics of men taking over a segment of feminism to work primarily for men instead of advancing feminism. Menslib is something I don't know enough about to describe well, but it seems to self-reflexively examine masculinity and how to improve things for men without doubling-down on gender expectations.

Gnar in his normal form is squishy, has low damage when engaged upon and bad escapes (unless a minion wave is moving in), and mega gnar only has slow, telegraphed attacks. In a 2v2, the side with Gnar loses, especially if the opponent is something like Fiora (who wins against gnar in a 1v1 to begin with), GP (good AoE damage) and maybe even Lissandra.

A semi-random pattern, yes. That being close 2, far 2, close 2. Only issue is, thats still pretty unreliable. Because whether its vertical close or horizontal close and vertical and horizontal far matters a lot. Vertical far is fairly easy to proc. Horizontal far extremely difficult. Horizontal close is very easy to proc. Vertical close can be trickier. And the enemy can also abuse that by simply moving out of sight while he has close and force it into far.

Mmh, close ,but no cigar. No, the dash itself is indeed 400 range, but the important part is that that is purely the movement aspect. The damage aspect actually goes beyond 400. More precisely, the attack aspect is actuall an autoattack eminating from Fiora (which has a 150 melee range). Now, I think you can put 2 and 2 together and understand what that means. Precisely. She Qs into AA range, then puts her E slow on him (which is naturally substantionally stronger than Gnars at early levels), while also gaining a movement speed boost from her passive. So yes, if Fiora goes on him, he has to Hop immideatly, trying to kite is pointless as Fiora is on him, has slowed him for more than he slowed her for, has also gained bonus movement speed, has another dash up shortly (especially if her Q is higher than level 1) and does far more damage.

Yes yes, you are describing Lee, not Gnar. Lets make it clear why Gnar isnt a generalist. See, the trick about a generalist, as I mentioned, is that they can do everything at once. No downtime. If you pick Gnar, you have no way of guaranteeing that you have the teamfight stomper when you need him. You have no way to guarantee that you have the ranged kiter when you need him. He isnt a generalist. He is a niche character who can simply fulfill 2 different niches at different times, but has no guarantee that he can fulfill either at the time that is neccessary. 

The best way to explain this is using a fighting game as a metaphor. A generalist would be someone like Lee. Lets say in a fighting game they are a character who are good in every aspect. Neutral, crossup, block, etc. etc. He doesnt excel at any, but he is good at all of them, meaning there really is no reason to pick anyone else unless they excel in something very important (see: Lee Sin from release to season 4). Then we have Gnar who instead is a character who can do a lot of things, but only half of them at once. In one state, he is good at neutral and crossups, the other one good at blocks and so on.

Lets actually use a more precise version for this. Lets take SSBB. Now, Lee Sin is Falco or Fox. A jack of all trades, who really does everything. On the other hand, Gnar is Samus. One version, Zero suit, is good at plenty of things, but bad at others, the other, Samus, is good at plenty of other things, but bad at the things Zero suit is good at. Now Falco would actually make other picks redundant. Samus didnt, because both versions only did half.

As I expected, pure numerical value, which of course means that china with its unusual meta game skewed the statistic by virtue of being much bigger. 

Well even that is wrong, as I mentioned. For someone who is supposedly oppressive, he did very little oppressing.

And Im saying ,he doesnt. ""Dominating them in lane"" yeah thats what good picks tend to do. Though, to be fair, its not Gnar doing that. Its the actual top picks doing that. Gnar is more of a ""well, the better picks are already gone, guess Ill settle with seconds"" pick. And doing things better is also something the top picks do. Teemo and Renekton arent not being picked because of Gnar. They arent being picked because they suck. 

Maokai and Malphite arent being picked because you got shen and you also got Gragas in the jungle. Again, not because of gnar. 

He isnt. Because he doesnt do everything. He has the potential to do a lot, but the ability to only do part of it. And he doesnt drop other picks. But yknow, Im curious. Do you even have a single shred of evidence to back your claim up? Anything that even remotely ""proves"" that Gnar is the one blocking out picks instead of the reality that its the likes of Shen, Irelia and other top picks? 

I can, because you again looked at the raw numerical data. ",1

That makes sense. Actual 6% were highly gnc. That is cross conforming.

When GC complains highly cross conforming males are ""just conforming to another stereotype."" I kind of agree. In that sense I don't think people are escaping gender by conforming to the opposite gender norms.

I don't know what games you're playing, but Blizzard is extremely circle jerky about players having a 50% win rate. Every professional SCII player I look at stats wise either has + or - 50% across the board, or something else insane like a 70% win rate against a specific race, with the other two being significantly lower. When you are of comparable skill level at the top, there's no definitive player who wins 100% of the time. There are stints of time where specific players dominate because they have a grasp and mastery of the current meta, but the minute that meta goes into a paradigm shift and they aren't as proficient they may take a dive. In fact its so common in SCII, that a lof ot players will have these amazing tournament runs, and then get patched into obscurity because their meta is over. They even coined the phrase ""That player is a Patch (Terran,Protoss,Zerg).""

"> What two things can't be true? Are you saying lorentz transformations prove time is a spatial dimension?

No, Lorentz transformations were a practical way to answer a pressing question that predated relativity. As it happens, the method produced results consistent with observation, and as Special Relativity took shape around it, it led to the idea that time is a dimension orthogonal to the space dimensions, something Minkowksi was first to notice.

> I don't know how you came to that conclusion, because I definitely don't see it.

Here is a brief exposition on the Lorentz transformation in the context of Special Relativity: Reference frames, coordinates and the Lorentz transformation

Briefly, and limiting ourselves to one spatial dimension and time:

[; t' = \gamma(t - \frac{v x}{c^2}) ;]

-- and --

[; x' = \gamma(x - v t) ;]

-- where --

[; \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} ;]

-- and x' and t' are transformed space and time at velocity v.

If one thinks through the geometry expressed above as Minkowski did, one quickly sees that it describes X and T as orthogonal, i.e. as dimensions, and the spacetime relation is more efficiently expressed as a four-dimensional system.

Minkowski's contribution to Special, and later General, Relativity was recognized as a great simplification compared to what preceded it, a time when people were treating space and time as geometrically orthogonal without realizing what that meant.

The Jedi and the ""Church"" are not the same thing. Luke was taught to be an individual not how to run an organization so he fell back and used the established rules of that organization. 

Obi-Wan saying a Lightsaber is a Jedi's life for example. That seems pretty un-Jedi like. Forcing kids into a philosophy they cannot possibly comprehend. Getting involved politically in general seems pretty un-Jedi. This is what led to their fall. These are also not things that Luke was taught. 

> Not the Catholic church, but you would be able to lead a Church. 


But that's not what is happening. Leading the Church is not the same as recreating the Church. Sure Luke probably would have been great if the Jedi Counsel was still around. He likely would have been a breathe of fresh air. But that's not the situation he was in. He was trying to resurrect a dead religion using almost entirely second hand information and tall tales. 


> And if anyone would've realized this about Anakin, it is Luke. Luke using Anakin's emotions means Luke is also not an emotionless monster. Right there he is already philosophically incompatible with the ways of the Old Jedi Order, so I just disagree that he would seek to recreate the Old Jedi Order in its entirety. 

Why would he? He didn't know his father. All he knew was he betrayed the Jedi. You are right that he is philosophically incompatible. But his goal wasn't to improve the Jedi (which it should have been), it was to recreate the Jedi. Being great at something does not mean you'd make a great teacher. Just like being a great cook does not mean you know how to run a restaurant. 


Its not to say that Luke could not have been a great master or leader but he was doing more than he could handle with no one around to show him.

This is something which you should have just left in the other thread (which you did post in, no reason to post it here too)!

The point of that suggested rule is for past R/F decks to serve as a reference for newer players as well. They can see how past users built and changed their decks, and see exactly what cards they used. It would bring some much appreciated clarity.

> As far as Pulls posts go, it's basically going to become where you basically can't make them unless you're showing off something exotic, like a misprint. Normal pulls posts, where you're showing off the cool stuff out of the box you just bought? Won't be allowed anymore. That's kinda overkill on the rules, don't you think? One of the whole reasons I even hang out on this sub is because I don't really have anywhere else to talk about my Yugioh goingson. So if I buy some packs and get something awesome? I want to share it with people who will understand instead of talking about it to friends who have no idea what I'm saying. Like I recently bought a Cosmo Blazer Special Edition, hoping to get like... a Tenki or two for my potential Bujin deck, maybe a Bear for trades. I wound up with an Ultimate Rare Tiger King. So of course I was excited and wanted to tell people who actually care about it (and someone joined in on the thread telling me they too would be getting some Cosmo Blazer and would be posting their pulls shortly). 

If you would look at the discussion thread which is literally actually meant for the discussion of this proposed change, you'd see that someone recently suggested some sort of weekly pulls thread. That sort of thread was in consideration early on before the final implementation of the weekly threads, and likely could see a comeback with this new proposed rules, so you would still have an outlet to share those sorts of things.

> Overall, it feels like the rules are getting a bit too restrictive. I understand that there's a need to try and keep things ""in order"". But guess what? This is Reddit. It has a system for that built in already. If a thread doesn't generate any discussion? It will either be downvoted or won't stay on the main page for long. 

The point of the rules is so we don't have to rely on a easily manipulated voting system. The voting system on reddit is far from perfect, and with this subreddit being so small and inactive, it isn't like a topic will disappear off the front page in a matter of hours. It will stay up there. Hell, there have been posts down in the negatives that have been in the top 25 of this subreddit. Downvotes are not enough to discourage disallowed content.

That, and this argument is really weak. If downvotes were all it took to take care of posts which shouldn't be encouraged, why would any subreddit bother having rules at all? 

> And R/F posts and Pulls posts are a mainstay of the sub. 

Ha, pulls being a mainstay? They're allowed here, but it'd be an outright embarrassment if what our subreddit was known for was just pulls posts. R/F posts? Yeah, those are a big deal, and the rules in place a meant to improve upon their content.

> If you don't like those posts? Ignore them. It should be that simple. 

The fact you are saying this shows how little you understand reddit still.

"> deploying trunk of any software strikes me as a really bad idea

If by ""deploying trunk"" you mean blindly doing an `svn up` on the production servers every few hours/days, then sure. But if you mean checking out a particular revision and sticking to it for a while, upgrading when some feature or bug you cared about lands, then no, ""deploying trunk"" is just fine.

In a larger sense I think this is a mindset issue: there are plenty of projects which have no problems breaking `HEAD` and leaving it broken for a while, and so people naturally develop a strong aversion to it. But there are just as many projects which take a strong stance on keeping trunk stable, which isn't hard if you're a bit strict about it.

In the case of Django, for example, the policy for trunk is that no feature gets checked in without documentation and a passing test suite, and there's a buildbot running 24 hours a day to verify the full test suite after every commit. Significant features get done in a branch, and merge back only when complete and tested.

And so Django's trunk is remarkably stable; many people -- including Debian -- regularly snapshot it and deploy/distribute it. ",1

"Yes, psychics and fortune-tellers are full of shit, I agree.

The tarot is not about that, not even a little. If you attempt to tell someone their future, you are a charlatan and nothing more.

My life has been irrevocably changed for the better as a result of working with it, through it, and seeing life from its lens. I see life, all interactions, all changes, all experiences symbolically. I don't read cards to tell my future, I read them to understand myself, and what I've learned. I read cards for others to do the same, to provide a symbolic context in their life, to connect them and empower them with mythological and esoteric symbolism. I am not a psychic, and I make that clear to everyone I work with. More or less, I am a symbolic co-engineer of consciousness. Symbols change consciousness. Consider the crucifix, corporate logos, countries' flags, the symbols on the dollar bill. Do you really think these are there to just be pretty? They do things to your subconscious. 

Look at the work CG Jung did with the tarot and archetypes. His psychology is real psychology. Freud never cured or helped anyone, any success he claimed was fabricated and full of shit. Look it up.

Ultimately it is subjective, but subjectivity is the way we all experience reality. We all have our individual experiences. When you connect to something symbolic and inherently mystical like the tarot, and use it as a guide, to affirm and explore the present, to empower you, you connect with something larger than yourself in your myopic bubble. Life becomes more than just making money, fucking, and dying. Life becomes a mystical classroom of experience, one where you can witness what lessons you are learning, where you receive homework, where you get graded. 

I suggest you try reading from the I-Ching, or something with less ""woo-woo"" connotations than the tarot. You may yet discover something that will open your subjective experience to a new realm of possibility for personal growth.

Skepticism is healthy. Indeed, I am an occultist and also a skeptic. But ultimately the materialist perspective that science has thus far cultivated cannot explain everything, it cannot reduce the world to an unintelligent material model, as much as it tries to. You will only come to learn certain things by exploring them yourself, by directly experiencing them. Once you have a gnostic experience, you will realize the error of materialist thinking. ",1

Sure I agree limited snaps because he was injured makes sense. I don't think he was given near enough especially due to lack of depth this game but like you said I'm not a coach.

BUT Last year does matter. If the Broncos came out and benched Von Miller week one it wouldn't make sense right? Why bench a guy after a good season before he can even play a game? Jerry has played in 6 games this year with 0 starts and has 2 sacks compared to Emanuels 0 in 10 starts. Jerry has 7 tackles compared to Emanuels 15. Emanuel has 1 career sack and it was week 1 his rookie year!

From watching him every week and by looking at the stats Emanuel isn't a good pass rusher while Attouchu on the other hand has 8 times the sacks Emanuel does in significantly less snaps. But you say Emanuel is good at seting the edge well so is THE #1 PLAYER AGAINST THE RUN 

So knowing all this is think we all should come to the conclusion that Attouchu>Emanuel. So if Attouchu has and still is out playing Emanuel but Emanuel is still starting above him (and even Williams is) then I'm starting to think it might not be all about the injury... but hey, I'm not a coach right?

Put aside the strawman that I was not arguing that point, and see that this sentence doesn't make sense, on its face... and it isn't the only one in that comment. There are a number of those types of things in nearly every comment you make.

I am not sure if you are aware of how poorly you word things (or perhaps type things)... a simpler and less annoying but still difficult thing here is when you refer to America as if it has one mode. Most Americans do not view homosexuality as bad or funny. Every study I have seen agrees with this. Does this mean that no Americans feel that way? No. But referring to our country as some singular entity like, ""America laughs at X or doesnt"" is just going to bring the conversation to a halt.

But that said, I don't want to end the convo either, I just can't argue points that I didn't make. You said,:

>You¡¯re getting hung up on this tangent in a pretty accusatory way. I¡¯m trying to communicate properly.

The reason I am hung up on it is because assuming things that I didn't say derails communication. I can't defend or explain a concept to you that I don't hold.

 So stop making assumptions and try to be a little more clear, yeah?

Ok, so put on your big boy pants and suspend your disbelief for the time it takes to imagine that Trump dotes over Trudeau. Let's also assume that a vast majority of Americans think that a close relationship with Russia is bad, but a close relationship with Canada is good.

Trump can't tweet with Putin's dick in his tiny hands.

Trump can't tweet with Trudeau's dick in his tiny hands.

These 2 jokes (given the circumstances we are supposing for the sake of the discussion) are the exact same joke. Neither of them imply negativity. The only reason the relationship is viewed negatively is because of how YOU AND I feel about Trumps relationship with Putin.

 In fact, if you are capable, suspend your disbelief further to just take Trump out of it all together. That solidifies how poor your argument about what the joke implies is:

Leader A can't tweet with Leader B's dick in their tiny hands.

What can be gleaned from this? Does this imply negativity? No, it doesnt. As the previous 2 examples illustrate, A and B can be a positively perceived relationship or it could be a negatively perceived relationship. My point here, is that if a person thinks that joke inherently implies negativity, it is only because THAT PERSON holds some semblance of the idea that homosexuality is wrong or funny. Maybe it would be different in Zimbabwe or Iran, but we are not in Zimbabwe or Iran. Here, there are plenty of people (a majority) who do not think that joke implies negativity because they do not share the connotation that gay = bad or funny (we can just say stigmatized, that covers both).

If your point is that lgbt are an historically oppressed people and that this means that any joke describing a negatively perceived relationship in any lgbt manner is going to be an offensive joke, you are not entirely wrong. It will absolutely be viewed as offensive by SOMEONE. But none of that makes the joke inherently offensive. I can say that the sky is blue and someone who works night shifts will get offended because their sky is black with white dots. Did my statement create the feeling of being offended? Yes. Was my comment offensive? No.

Now, as to implicit homophobia: Yes, it is a real thing. Yes, it is possible for people to not see their own biases or prejusice. No, it is not what is going on here. As the examples above illustrate, the joke works without negativity. You seem to be completely hung up on the idea that there is no way the same joke would work without the percieved negativity, but it can and does. They are the same joke. Even the anonymous one can be easily deciphered by a person of even sub average intelligence. Leader A tweets. Leader A has tiny hands. Leader A is close somehow to leader B. 

The inherently negative connotation exists only in your mind. Let go of that shit man, homosexuality is not funny or bad. YOU are keeping the stigma alive. The joke was not inherently doing that. YOU are doing that.

I would argue that everything you are saying here does far more damage to keeping those negative connotions alive than the joke... ",0

You're not getting to what faith is in the first place, which is odd, because your first excerpt in your response is a statement I made after explaining what faith necessarily has to be even if you wanted to simplify it into ""a trust in Christ"". You also do this with my given citation of 1 Peter, and you still give no reason for us to believe your exegesis and the techniques therein with which you come to your conclusion, versus clear verses that have been unambiguously understood in the way that I, DKowalsky, and many others throughout even the earliest centuries of Christianity understand them.

Instead you become more aggressive.

">Well to be fair I already stated the post was too long to read in detail but I skimmed it and got the gist because I've heard all these arguments before, and your responses confirms that:

Then just read the parts relevant to what we are discussing. 

>Luke: The bigger they are, the harder they fall. Meaning, Luke had been so successful, was such a legend, that when the son of Han and Leia, his own nephew, turns to the dark side and destroys everything, I believe that Luke, being a very emotional guy, would take it really hard and come to question everything he had previously believed.

He was emotional in the sense he was very empathetic but he had incredible control over his emotions, thats why Vader and sidious gave up on trying to turn him to the dark side. If Luke with little training had such incredible control over his emotions then he isnt going to completely mentally break to the point where he isnt even recognisable to who he used to be. Just because of what Kylo did. If what kylo did hurt him so much why would he then hide and leave Kylo to go off and do even worse things for the next few years ? Not only does it go completely against the empathetic part of Lukes character but giving up on Kylo goes against the never giving up on hope part of Lukes character and its by far the most logically dumb decision he could have made. 

>Rey: She certainly has less training than most people, but training isn't necessarily all that important. Anakin got lots of it but he still went wrong. 

Exactly he got a bunch of training and still had issues, that shows how important training is and how stupid it is that rey is so capable without any. 

>And he was already moving things with the Force and seeing things on a testing screen before he ever had any training, 

As if any of that is even close to what Rey did with no training ? 

>Luke could block lasers and blow up the Death Star and move things after a conversation with Obi-Wan, etc.

Again i covered this in my original post and last reply to you and you seem top have ignored it. 

>We didn't see him get much training from Yoda either. Like I said, the Force comes out in powerful people. It's consistent. 

He practiced for three years between ANH and ESB and was still barely able to move his lightsaber with tk. when hed just had those brief lessons from obi wan he needed hours just to move a noodle with tk. So how can you say its reasonable rey lifts dozens of tonnes of stone without strain with even less training ? Luke was so powerful he had the potential to surpass sidious the most powerful sith ever. But by comparison to Rey he looks weak and incompetent. 

>And TLJ certainly calls into question the value of dogmatic training.

It never questions it at all...it just stomps on it to make rey super powerful and destroy any tension or challenge Rey may face. How can you seriously think needed to train for years to competantly use the force is worse than just having anyone become uber powerful in days ?

>I can't think of any reason why Rey being powerful could bother someone so much unless they're bothered by having a really powerful female character.

For the many reasons i've given but you havent read...

>If Finn was a woman and Rey was a man, in other words, if the man was much better at everything than the woman, it might be sexist because that's been done so many times before. The situation being reversed isn't sexist; it's a much needed corrective breath of fresh air.

Except the issue isnt making a man way more competent than the woman or vice verse. Its making one character way more competent that the other in every way. Is Luke was a better pilot, mechanic and talker than Han that would be an issue because Han would be redundant. 

>Leia: Used the Force to pull herself towards something in zero gravity. That's not that big of a Force power.

Again ignoring all the explanation i gave as to why its ridiculous. If you arent going to read my original post don't bother replying. Im not going to skip out points and evidence from my arguement because you cant be bother to read it.

>Snoke: I'm glad he was killed off because he was uninteresting. Focusing on Kylo and Rey was much more interesting than telling Snoke's backstory, which Rian Johnson realized. I'm sure it will be told some day, but it didn't need to be told in this movie. It's fine that you want to know more.

Its clear you aren't even reading my replies let alone my original post. my last reply on this comment perfectly counters what you just said ""You're are glad about that because he's just be made to be diet sidious and they did nothing with him that made him interesting despite all the potential he had.

My issue is killing him off before making him any sort of an interesting charatcer and not explaining how the hell he undid all the achievements of the ot hero's and reset it to a worse version of its ANH state.instead he just pops out of nowhere and it just all happens due to all the hero's being incredibly incompetent all of a sudden.""

But this is EXACTLY the problem with how men's and women's issues are being presented--as a zero sum. And I fundamentally disagree that it is zero sum. I hear what you're saying in the case of rape prosecution, and that is a special case. But with other issues prominent to feminism (right to choose, wage gap [and please let's not get derailed on whether/why it is a thing, that is NOT the point here], underrepresentation) and the MRM (custody, incarceration/sentencing bias, conscription), there isn't a tradeoff. They're separate. Sure, if we increase representation of women, proportionally the representation of men goes down, but if they're still overrepresented, I don't see that as a problem unless the way we increased representation was unjust in the first place--in which case we should be working on fixing the problem more equitably for EVERYONE's interests. I think cases where men's and women's rights are fundamentally in opposition are the minority. If you could show that this is not the case, and that more feminist societies oppress men, you would almost certainly CMV.

Umm, pretty sure if one group is disadvantaged and another group is not that puts the group that's not disadvantaged at an advantage. That's kind of how things work.

I only argue this because this stupid shit about men's right's only and always pops up in response to some discussion of women's rights. It's like whenever a woman complains about something that men do, some dipshit man pops up and needs to be patted on the head and assured that no, not all men do that. 

> Making everything a women's issue solves nothing and only serves to disregard that men also face issues and that women are capable of being anything but victims.

Or it's a recognition of the current power balance in the world we live in and trying to direct the response to the root of the problem rather than just trying to enforce some false equality. Take custody for instance. It's wrong that women are routinely awarded custody over men even when the facts of the situation don't support that, but if we just start trying to enforce some rules that artificially prevent that without attacking the real problem, i.e. traditional roles of men/women in parenting then the outcome is always going to be less than ideal and virtually impossible to actually enforce.

"Wikipedia's definition is more complete;

>Rape is a type of sexual assault usually involving sexual intercourse or other forms of sexual penetration carried out against a person without that person's consent. The act may be carried out by physical force, coercion, abuse of authority, or against a person who is incapable of giving valid consent, such as one who is unconscious, incapacitated, has an intellectual disability or is below the legal age of consent. The term rape is sometimes used interchangeably with the term sexual assault.

Whether or not he actually did that, I don't know. I don't think Monica Lewinsky has ever claimed that Bill Clinton raped her, or committed anything like rape. But a person's authority over another person absolutely can be coercion, and that coercion absolutely can bypass any reasonable understanding of consent.

If a professor threatens to fail a student for not sucking his dick, that would be rape. Obviously the most powerful man on the planet's ability to coerce an intern is much higher than that of a professor coercing a student.

"A throwaway so I don't get harassed again. I posted this not too long ago, but it's still valid.

While I personally think that weed should be legal, there are a lot of issues that legalizers don't take into account. I mean, it's as simple as passing a few laws, right? Not so much.

The first and biggest problem is that no one is honest about the issue. We hear lots of talk about how it's good for treating this disease or how it can ease pain or whatever. We never hear someone state, simply and honestly, ""I want marijuana to be legal so I can get high."" Instead we'll find every reason that we can come up with except for the obvious one, and if it does come up, there a lot of harrumphing and subject-changing. We want to smoke pot & get high without getting in trouble. Get over yourself and say it, don't push for medical marijuana and then suddenly develop chronic pain with no specific symptoms. You're not fooling anyone.

The other big pro-weed argument is how if weed were legalized, then we could tax it and fix the deficit! Yay, right? Not quite. There are a lot of problems with that: How will you tax it? The same way that we tax cigarettes? That means that there would have to plantations or farms or what have you. That might be okay, but what about the people that want to grow their own? Will there standards; i.e., will the FDA set standards that have to be followed? Will the people that grow their own have to meet these standards? How will you tax the people that grow a little extra to sell to their friends?

Here's something else to consider: if weed were magically legal as of tomorrow, there'd be a whole lot of people out of work. All the dealers, growers, suppliers, etc. would suddenly have to compete with corporations. What happens to them? Do you really think they're going to be happy that all their clients don't have to deal with them any longer?

And then there's the day-to-day concerns. What will the legal age be to legally purchase weed? Will there be a limit on how much you can buy at once? People aren't too fond of smokers these days; how will we deal with people smoking pot in public? How will you deal with people driving while high, or being disorderly while high? Will police officers be able to demand a piss test on the spot? How would that even work?

Correct me if I'm wrong, but even if weed was legal employers would still very likely be able to require drug tests of their employees. Unless there's a good way to determine if someone has smoked in the past few hours (similar to a Breathalyzer test for alcohol), it's entirely reasonable that employers could simply dismiss smokers based on the way drug tests work now, which means if you have smoked in the past few days your job could be in jeopardy.

Finally, the legalizers need to stop quoting bullshit studies and linking to pro-pot websites. Let's see some peer-reviewed journals with legitimate medical doctors presenting evidence (I say this because if I have to read that article written by a physicist one more time I'm choking someone with a hookah. He's not a medical doctor!). If you refer me to a website with ""420"" in the title, pot leaf gifs, or tie-dye backgrounds anywhere on the page, you've instantly lost credibility. No one is going to take anything listed on these websites seriously. Deal with it. Make a boring website where the focus is on the information, not all the users' sweet-ass bongs, man. It will make a huge difference.

Also, people aren't fooled by calling it all your cutesy little nicknames. Grow up and call it what it is. You're not fooling anyone that thinks about it for more than a minute, and by hiding behind a bunch of asinine slang, you're only reinforcing that you have something to hide. Be honest about what you're doing, and you'll gain a lot more respect than you do now.

Not that in actually matters in PC Bangs, because you get to play the game if you pay for the PC Bang, Blizzard has a deal going where it unlocks OW and other games on the PCs there.

So it's just completely unreliable as far as play numbers are concerned. Good to know.

No, it can't very easily be a bubble as it turned a profit year one. At the minnimum, the assets are worth more than what was paid for them year 1.

> If you say so, again just your opinion.

some opinions are better than others. In this case mine, since I didn't make something up that goes against conventional wisdom based of no evidence

> Indeed, developing new players and ensuring that esport is a viable career path is not important for the league. And although they have tier 2 or 3 orgs, they do not have the money or tournaments to support those orgs, and their numbers and size are nowhere near what they were before the OWL.

You mean to tell me the year 1 structure didn't measure up to the multi year structure in year 1? You don't say! 

> So by your logic the OWL lost 100k viewers because of ESPN, yet ESPN had worse numbers than they usually do. I really don't follow your train of logic here, shouldn't ESPN have seen higher viewership than average if you say that the OWL did not alienate any of their usual viewers and instead brought in viewers taken from Twitch?

This might be your dumbest paragraph so far, which is really saying something. 

1. There is 0 evidence that they alienated viewers
2. You have not shown me anything to suggest that the numbers are lower than normal for the slot
3. OWL lost ~300k viewers to ESPN

> The playoffs week 1 out of 3 had lower viewership than the stage before it too, unlike any sport.

Except it didn't since you aren't counting ESPN 3 and Disney XD viewers, which took an estimated 150k. So like everything else you've posted, wrong

1. The league was profitable for the teams as well
2. Initial investment is not profit rofl. Do you even understand basic accounting and business practices?

> and they are getting another 180 million, on top of 200 million dollars from sponsors and Twitch overpaying them

Or how that would make his kit even weaker against AD opponents because even if he was crushing lane he would get outscaled because his passive would be worthless.

She is pretty inconsistent and seems more like a plot device rather than a well-rounded character. (I feel that way about Hamlin too.) You can't exactly say who she is and what her motivations are, especially when it comes to her relationship with Jimmy.

When I first watched the show - I binge watched all the 3 seasons - the show putting Jimmy in a relationship with Kim came as a surprise to me and didn't make much sense for me. Considering Jimmy's character evolution, what they were going for in season one seemed like the right way: he was a struggling lawyer in financial troubles, everybody told him he was like a shady person/lawyer, his brother and personal idol turned out to be among that crowd too, his best friend passed away, and the girl he liked rejected his offer for a partnership. Jimmy's character was at a perfect point to enter the next phase of his evolution. But in season 2 they suddenly backpedaled.

Now, I have a theory of my own! Watching the show and reading some interviews by Gilligan (and Gould) gave me the feeling and the idea that the show creators, Vince Gilligan especially, became so fascinated by and interested in Michael McKean's performance as Chuck that they wanted to give him more storylines and to keep him around longer to act as the mentally ill and vindictive older brother.

LMAO no. The idea to boot Christy came from Rob initially it's clearly not something that Jenna or Heidi proposed to him. We know that from what we saw on screen and we've also seen him give the rationale for booting Christy and why he did it. We also saw his reactions after Christy was booted and literally nothing to suggest that he changed his vote during tribal. That's fanfiction from your end.

In addition he's said this in exit interviews/retrospectives. 

Jenna has never mentioned your entirely baseless percentages that you pull out of nowhere and nothing she has ever said suggested that even factored into her decision.

> I don't think Rob is dumb enough to expect that Heidi would be any more likely to take him to the end and so at that point I think his concern would be who he's likely to beat which we know he considered to be Jenna.

But as I said Jenna already rebuffed him and tried to blow up his spot earlier, she also never gives this rationale in the episode this is entirely you giving your version of why you think she made this move. 

> I do remember it was Survivor 6. Rob is known for being bold in general and if new information presented itself at Tribal Council I see no reason he wouldn't have acted on it, he was hardly playing a Moto Maji type game.

He also has to change Matt's vote at tribal doing so to get majority during that time it's not as simple as you make it out to be. Also during that time the risks of a tie vote were not half as well known Rob and others have stated numerous times that they weren't as sure about the rules back then as we are now. 

> Not stupid if there's no risk. If he was voting out Christy anyway like you say then it was at worst netural.

What are you talking about ? Of course there's a risk by giving away her immunity and becoming the other potential target at that tribal. She received Butch and Christy's votes at that tribal and easily could have been eliminated with Rob's and Matt's. 

If Rob and Matt go into that tribal voting Heidi and Jenna gives away her immunity they are much more likely to stick on Jenna rather than switch their vote to Christy for that tribal as you suggest and it's certainly not no risk - that's just incredulous. 

> Does Jenna ever say that she's doing it for any reason besides keeping herself safe in the episode? No, so literally anything we say would be speculative but like if we look at the pretty clear ways the move benefits her I don't think it's a stretch to say she was aware of them.

In no way does the move benefit her like at all. I would say you're being results oriented but this didn't even have an impact in changing the direction of thee game it has no benefits and the clear downside is she's a very viable boot at that stage. 

There's probably more to suggest that she wanted to quit and didn't mind leaving in the place of Heidi given that we were shown that she was contemplating quitting and also given Christy's

Either because she didn't mind leaving at that point or because she just wants to extend a friendly gesture to her ally. 

In any case you're missing the point even with the rationale you've given for Jenna (if it's correct) it's still a terrible move and a ridiculous risk to take.

">It's a slash and burn approach to treating the symptoms, not the disease.

Unfortunately one of the main causes of the disease you mentioned is a relatively slim pool of heroes, it's not slash and burn, it's a band-aid. 

> Well, fair enough, that can be irritating, but if overtime mechanics stay the same, then you'll just wind up with 3 additional heroes with mobility, it will not solve the problem that stacking is symptomatic of.

>Not only the raging and whining, but what if the enemy has a Bastion? It's a good example of a hero with specific counters and that needs to be dealt with. I'm not good at Widow, Genji or Hanzo, so my go to counter is Pharah, but what if we already have one? Well, either we have to rely on that player to counter, I have to pick something I suck at or we lose. That isn't right.

You're in competitive mode, where everyone needs to pull their own weight, so here's my answer:

Either stay out of competitive until you consider yourself decent enough at multiple heroes, or communicate with your Pharah so that she makes it her number 1 priority to deal with the Bastion. 

If you can't successfully do either of these things, maybe your team didn't deserve to win? 

> What this means is that in competitive mode, you MUST be able to play all heroes really well

First of all, no. This is not the case, and it's pretty obvious you're exaggerating. Let's take your previous example and expand upon it:

Bastion is not an invincible juggernaught against anyone not named Pharah, Genji, Widow, or Hanzo. In fact most if not all of the offensive heroes have a relatively simple time taking him out with the exception of maybe an ult-less Tracer, and even then you have unparalleled mobility. The beauty of an fps with so many heroes is that the counters and matchups are more akin to a fluid than a rigid chart. 

Maybe I'm projecting or being a dick, and if it comes across that way I apologize in advance, but in nearly every strongly competitive multiplayer game (assuming you're in solo-queue where you won't always get your role), you need to be at a competent level for nearly every position. Even in the case of 1-hero type per team you can usually get away with maining 2 or 3 roles.

I'd also like to point out that maining 2 or 3 roles is different from what you said here:

"> Many are still operating with outdated pre-clinical ideologies like letter grades, class rank, and mandatory attendance. 

this isn't exclusive to DO schools at all. 

>They cling to outdated concepts like OMM, most schools don¡¯t teach to what is on boards, and often scrape the bottom of the barrel to scrounge up professors. Which amounts to a very poor preclinical foundation unless the students say fuck it, shell out exorbitant amounts of money for external teaching tools like Boards and Beyond, Pathoma, Sketchy 

Most MD students shell out about a thousand for B&B, pathoma, and sketchy. 

>And even then if you use High Yield material to study for tests you may very well fail simply because professors go out of their way to test material that isn¡¯t high yield or they will take a high yield concept and over complicate it to the nth degree just to keep the average low.

Question, what year are you? Because if you're a M1 or M2, you have no idea what's high yield. You only know what's on board review material. Which isn't all, ""high yield."" Correlation with Uworld, sure, but i doubt an M1 or M2 at this point in the calendar year is using uworld, which are the gold standard board style questions.

>just to keep the average low

If you're P/F, it doesn't matter. Relative ranking matters. In either case, I doubt any school wants to fail more than 1-3% of any given class. So it would be curved regardless. 

>It¡¯s a common joke that DO schools are worse than MD schools but it¡¯s true, but not because the students are dumb/bad/worse than MD students.

Yeah no, DO students are objectively worse test takers. MCAT, GPA, STEP, you name it. On average, DO students are poorer test takers. 

>It was confirmed to me by a faculty member that at the last major faculty meeting the board of trustees and the dean decided to lower the typical exam average from an 84 to an 80 just for the sole purpose that it would push a few people below the passing threshold.

I very much doubt this. Accrediting bodies watch grad rates closely. It spells trouble for schools when they fail a certain amount of students. That said, think through the logic. Supposedly, you're making a few extra K. Why not just boost a few rota sites with preceptor sites and add more slots instead? Additionally, there's an issue with your school's rank if you're seen as producing students who routinely fail their boards. It's self-defeating.

"> I criticized the social justice movement and you said that any such criticism compares to what you perceive to be institutional racism/sexism.

Indeed. That isn't ""whataboutism"", because it's not talking about something else, saying ""what about that"". Instead, I'm challenging your notion that the ""social justice movement"" is responsible for the rise of anti-feminism and white nationalism. I see it as the opposite: sexism and racism were there first, they gave rise to the social justice movement, which is now being attacked by people who don't seem to understand why it exists in the first place.

> Are you talking about a few nazis on Stormfront?

There are more than a few, and they have different names now, like the ""Alt-Right"" and ""White Nationalists.""

>Because most anti-feminists support equal rights

Sorry, I don't buy that, and unless you have actual data that supports your claim I'm going to have to call BS. Now, some of these anti-feminists may claim they are for equal rights, but they'll be just as quick to dismiss any actual examples of sexism.

>they just oppose what they perceive modern feminism as having become.

I am very well aware of what proponents of this point of view believe, I simply think they are wrong.

>Just as nazis have every right to say that black people and Jews are inferior.

Interesting how you compare people who fight oppression with those who defend it...

>That doesn't mean you shouldn't criticize them for their ideas or for their approach.

Sure, the problem is that most criticism of feminism or of minority rights advocates is boneheaded, and based in deep-rooted sexism/racism, while criticism of nazis is completely justified.

>but when you call for art you don't like to stop existing or you try to get all of your Twitter followers to mass contact the company to remove content you don't like, you are advocating against free expression

Not really. You are engaging is free expression yourself - and it's not about ""art you don't like"", it's about media that perpetrates racist/sexist stereotypes. In any case, pressuring twitter or Disney to remove a sandbox for someone spewing hateful view towards people based on their gender or ethnic origin is just fine.

>In other words, you want to force developers to adopt your political views. 

No, I don't. There are such a thing as minimum standards of quality and decency. They don't have to be very high

>Nobody should have to ""adopt"" any sort of standards when it comes to art.

Are we talking about art, or video games? Because the latter are not necessarily art - and I say this as a professional game developer.

But, yeah, there are some minimum standards that publishers abide by, and for good reason.

>Different people enjoy different art and entertainment, and that's fine. It's not some great societal issue, it's people having different tastes and different interests... it's diversity.

Sorry, but no. Publishers have a responsibility to the public, and to their shareholders. Putting out a game where you're a KKK guy lynching blacks would immediately make the publisher fair game for a boycott, and perhaps a lawsuit under hate speech laws (where appropriate).

>It's related to gender politics, because you're making it related to gender politics. 

Not at all. It's related to gender politics because it's about gender politics.

>If for instance, a study showed that women interrupt men at a higher rate than the reverse, I wouldn't go around telling women to stop ""femterrupting."" 

Why not? If we were living in a matriarcal society, where women had significant social, economical and political advantages over men, and you were a young man doing his best to advance in a women-dominated world, you'd be completely justified in using such an expression.

Which natural behaviour? We're not apes; we don't need to passively let kids beat the crap out of each other just because it's their first impulse.

> Demonization of male sexuality.

That is widely overblown by feminists, an argument exacerbated when you guys respond with even more vitriol.

> Ever-expanding definitions of ""sexual assault"".

That's not oppression, hon. The media might expand sexual assault definitions, but the definition by law hasn't changed. You're not going to be arrested, charged and convicted of rape if you kiss a drunk girl. You're a big boy, you know what you're allowed to do and what you're not allowed to do. And if you have to ask yourself ""will this get me in trouble?"", the answer is yes, don't do it.

> Entire departments in Universities whose sole person is to demonize men and dream up new ways of hurting them.

Do these departments have names?

> Discrimination in the form of affirmative action.

That is not oppression. That's a misunderstanding of how affirmative action works. Affirmative Action is a set of policies that ensure that employers don't simply discount someone as a work candidate because of their background. It also sets out guidelines that direct employers to remain objective when terminating employment. It was put in place because of nationwide concerns that employers were passing over candidates who were more qualified because of sex, race, or disability, and were setting priorities for termination based on the same things. That has now changed, and the culture of business has changed, but I don't think legislators are comfortable rescinding that policy because no one trusts that business will not revert to its past culture.

> Complete lack of reproductive rights.

You have the right to bodily integrity and autonomy. You have parental rights as a father on a child's birth certificate. You just don't have the right to violate a woman's bodily integrity in order to defend your claim to your DNA. See, one human right cannot infringe upon another. That's contradictory. The rules of our society have been as clear as rules get, long before any of us became sexually active. If you produce a child, you are responsible for it. That is the child's right, which you must also respect, if you value rights.

> Biased family courts that frequently result in fathers being denied access to their children while still being forced to subsidized their ex-wives.

That is a grossly oversimplified description of the problem, but we have one solid example now.

> Not being permitted to vote without signing your body over to the state.

That's not a men's rights issue. That's a citizenship-level issue. In Canada and many other nations, you are not required to sign up for the ""draft"", as no draft exists. We only have to pay our taxes in order to vote. In Switzerland, all citizens serve at least 12 months.

> Relative lack of services provided by the state, even though men pay the majority of taxes.

...this one is definitely a one-sided view of the issue. Women complain of the same thing, that services are extremely poor, and not worth the money paid into them. Furthermore, the term ""majority"" is misleading, as the difference is slim. Remember, the ""23% wage gap"" idea is a wholly flawed statistic.

> Relative lack of money devoted to male health care and male-specific cancer.

Citation, please.

> Male domestic violence victims often being arrested rather than seeing their abusers punished.

Is this really a common occurrence, or is it a highly publicized rarity?

> Little or no redress for victims of false accusations.

There's little that can be done. You're in America, do what Americans do. Sue the shit out of her. You make it seem like you want her strung up in the town square at high noon as recompense. We don't do that any more.

> Little or no redress for male victims of sexual assault, including boys (if the perpetrator is female).

What about all the articles that get posted here cheering that another woman and then another, and then another get the jail time they deserve (or complaining about how the outlet didn't call it a rape)?

If you want to call failed redress of sex crimes a rights issue, then it's not a men's rights issue, as women have the same complaints that you do; that rape is underpunished and that perpetrators walk free too often. Neither of you are wrong.

> Treated much, much more harshly by the criminal justice system.

I was led to believe that it wasn't a ""too harsh on men"", it was a ""too soft on women"" problem. Remember, we're dealing with criminals. We shouldn't be talking ""too harsh"" with people who violate the law. Men who go to jail serve a fair sentence - sometimes too fair. Women get kid-gloved, which is what needs to change.

"1) I never said that the Tories weren't going to win re-election, I said that Quebec was trying to deny them a majority. A strong NDP opposition would have put a major curb on Harper's power grabs, and we counted on progressives in Ontario and BC to follow through on this. The majority was never a foregone conclusion, and was in fact almost a surprise when the results were announced - the Orange Crush was the biggest story of the leadup, and most people thought that it had enough momentum to deny the Tories a majority. We know now this was wrong.

All that is besides the point anyway. The issue is that Quebecers have shows their willingness to put aside soveriegntist politics to vote for a federal party who represents the greater good for Canada as well as Quebec. The Bloc is a party that represents only Quebec's sovereigntist interest at the Federal level - the fact that they got destroyed as utterly as they did shows that Quebec is willing to put those interests aside. That's the point I was making.

2) That may be true, but the vast majority of the political rhetoric I've seen from Quebeckers in recent months has been anti-PLQ as opposed to anti-Harper.

The level of striking talent and coaching in MMA is significantly lower than the level of grappling talent and coaching. There are a few exceptions, but overall guys are not getting solid instruction on defense from the beginning of their careers. There was an interview Firas Zahabi did for sherdog.com with Patrick Wyman where he explained that a lot of the pros who come to him, even high level ones, are missing fundamentals. It's much easier to be a coach who teachers great athletes how to be aggressive and dangerous than it is to build defense into everything the fighter does. 

As for how the defense works in their game, every style can benefit from improved defense instead of leaping out of range. You have to use the specific techniques that fit best into your game of course--a wrestler doesn't want to stand on the outside trying to check and pull back from kicks--but once you do that you enjoy all the advantages.

Your last point is extremely flawed logic. If you need better defense it only means that you need better defense. You can put two guys with shit defense and dangerous offense against each other, and in that example BOTH guys need better striking defense more than they need better offense. Take Roy Nelson for example. Nobody ever beat him by deciding their striking defense was good enough. That's why he knocks out everyone who has bad defense, and gets dominated by everyone with good defense.

Leaping back out of range is just bad striking. I understand why it happens so often, but we don't need to make excuses for the best fighters in the world. ",1
"You keep going back to slavery when I already said it wasn't relevant. Why don't you engage with one of the examples I actually cited. You see a black person chastise a white person for wearing dreadlocks.

Is the white person allowed to wear dreadlocks? Is he allowed to even make a case for why he should be allowed to wear dreadlocks? Or should we just defer to the black person because she is black?

Or let's say you're at Yale when an email from an admin goes around suggesting we should respect students' ability to select their own Halloween costumes, a suggestion that earns the admin calls to resign or be fired:

But many of the students believe that his responsibility is to hear their demands for an apology and to issue it. They see anything short of a confession of wrongdoing as unacceptable.

"None of that makes you're viewpoint objectively true. It's only true if you accept all your axioms, one of which is, apparently, ""all violence is always wrong in every circumstance."" I reject that from the start, and as such nothing you say follows. Violence can be justified, at both and individual and societal level, in order to prevent further violence or other, worse harms. 

>Now, this is kindergarten level stuff, but trading something for something else is qualitatively different than threatening someone with violence if they don't give you what you want - literally: ""don't hit, use your words.""

I do agree that libertarian philosophy generally uses about a kindergarten-level of discourse in defining things like ""force"" and ""coercion"", so no disagreement there. In my opinion, the ability to threaten financial destitution, homelessness, starvation or death by disease is just as much a use of ""force"" as holding a gun to someone's head, which is the general relationship between employer and employee. In both cases ""give me money or I'll shoot you"" vs. ""work for x wage or go poor"", the exchange is free (both parties still technically have a choice), and mutually beneficial (the person with a gun/job opening gets money/labour and the other person doesn't get shot/starve), but in both cases the power imbalance is enormous and one person benefits far more. I consider both scenarios coercive, the only difference being one of degree. For further analogy, people usually view a superior requesting a n employee for sexual favours in return for a promotion to be coercive/unethical due to the power imbalance, and yet somehow if the thing being exchanged is labour instead it's all alright.


>If it is not wrong to use violence, then you are literally assenting to having violence used against you, meaning that were we having this disagreement in person, I could beat you into agreeing with me, and you would have no recourse but to simply agree and smile about it - it is a paradox precisely because might does not make right. 

Conversely, how do you protect property or even have the concept of property without either violence or the threat of violence? Property rights can only exist in a meaningful way if there is someone to enforce them. If you live in a stateless society, your right to property literally extends as far as you can personally protect it (i.e. might makes right). If you live in a normal society you have the government monopoly on legitimate force protecting your property for you - but to have that, you need to cede some small portion of that property to them in return for that protection (and a ton of other things). That's the agreement humans across the world in virtually every nation have made in order to have functional societies, which strikes me as justifying the ""violence"" the government employs through enforcing taxation.

"This is so frustratingly disingenuous. 

She spent a significant amount of time unemployed, by choice, so she could make a passion project. Her boyfriend paid the majority of the bills and also, presumably, didn¡¯t do any housework, which caused her to become annoyed and led to arguments. She credits her annoyance to her being a feminist. The subject of her passion project was learning about the anti-feminist internet movement, and thus credits her changing her mind about chores and bills to renouncing feminism. As a feminist who has no problem with fairness in bills/chores, this makes me facepalm. 

First, I have questions. I think it¡¯s fair for the person who pays the majority of the bills do less chores. But that doesn¡¯t give them the right to be a total slob of a human being. So I¡¯m curious just how much of a mess her boyfriend was making and expecting her to clean up, since this led to multiple arguments. If he puts his dirty laundry in the hamper and his dirty dishes in the sink, fine. Or does he just leave gross shit laying all over the house? Does he let stuff rot and go stinky is she¡¯s not home for a few days? So I¡¯d need more details before writing off her annoyance. I think it¡¯s perfectly fair for the person who pays less (especially if it¡¯s way less or nothing) in bills to handle the bulk of the chores, but that shouldn¡¯t turn them into a mothermaid who has to pick up dirty laundry and dirty dishes off the floor like you¡¯re their parent. An adult in a relationship is still responsible for basic respectful things like that.

So let¡¯s give the guy the benefit of the doubt, that he¡¯s respectful about not making chores even more of a pain than they need to be and functions like an adult. My next question would be wanting to know how the arguments went down. Because even if he¡¯s putting his dirty laundry in the hamper, I¡¯d like to know how he expresses his opinion that she should be the one to run the washer/dryer. Is it because he pays the bills, or is it because he thinks women should be the one who washes clothes regardless? She says she came to the bill inequality conclusion on her own, so what did this guy say in his own defense during their fights?

And like... feminism isn¡¯t newsletter. It isn¡¯t even a consensus. Feminists argue amongst themselves, a lot. It¡¯s how change happens, it¡¯s how the dialogue moves forward.

It is about how you are allowed to interact with other users and what you are allowed to say about people who disagree with you. It is considered especially bad to attribute politically-convenient-for-you motives to your outgroup that are not explicitly claimed by your outgroup.

>What, are we going to ban posts

We don't normally remove posts; we prefer to ban users and leave the comments up as ""heads on stakes"" examples.

>except insofar as presuming just about any basic moral judgment does

""People who voted for a POTUS who represents a major political party should get insulted on sight"" is not a ""basic moral judgment"".

>are we going to ban posts that assume the statement ""killing innocent people is bad"" because that's dismissing the views of military dictators?

That is not remotely comparable, and you reasonably ought to understand that.

We welcome ""the total democide attributable to the NSDAP is approximately 21 million, per the source Wikipedia cites"". We generally tolerate ""groups X and Y are arguing about whether it's acceptable to punch Nazis"" (although we discourage ""here's a link to group Y's summary of group X's policies re Nazism and why group X is terrible for thinking that way"" without additional context; that's the ""boo outgroup"" report reason). We explicitly solicit social commentary on what the category ""Nazi"" means in the current day, and the social consequences of combining a given definition with a given level of tolerance for physical violence. It is perfectly okay to say ""mass killings are bad, genocide is especially bad and the NSDAP were bad for perpetrating it"" - although you might get pushback on the identification of exactly who was responsible (e.g. ordinary citizens vs. the SS etc.) and how blame should be apportioned, because that is also okay here.

We don't tolerate ""User Z is a Nazi"". (If you think you have a case to report User Z to the Reddit admins based on the global Reddit rules, we cannot stop you, and would not want to stop you.)

>How exactly do you think you can maintain the project of not engaging with political debate when basic morality and facts are not agreed upon?

The project is not ""not engaging with political debate"". It is more like ""maintaining civility and emotional distance while discussing contentious topics that can be freely debated almost nowhere else, and coming to a clearer understanding of why people believe what they believe and how people can come to such radically different conclusions on the same observations"".

Most places that allow views outside the Overton window are only capable of allowing one at a time, and collapse into circlejerks around that view. Here, we've taken on what I deem an extraordinarily difficult project, that can only possibly succeed because of the high intelligence of the user base.

But ""disagreeing on the facts"" has nothing to do with the current discussion, AFAICT. You were initially objected to for referring to ""shitty social views""; please try saying the phrase ""objectively shitty"" out loud to yourself with a straight face.

">Your understanding of the term patriarchy is incredibly lacking, and it's not a definition that would be recognised by any feminist I know of. Perhaps this is why you find it hard to get on with feminism, because you've got some severe misunderstandings of the very basics.

Patriarchy. Men oppress women. Is that not what it means at its most basic core? ""Women cannot be sexist towards men because sexism= power+privilege.""


>It would be, were anyone claiming it.

You can't see the parallels in the rhetoric when you blame the ills of society entirely on masculinity?

>>A small percentage of men hold the power that is talked about in Patriarchy theory.

>This is simply not true. Patriarchy is a lot more subtle than capitalism or the class system, and affects power dynamics and relationships on an individual level as much as it does en masse. 

>At that level, you can see how the subtle expectations and behaviour differences between gender roles play out to disadvantage one group or the other (or often both, in different ways). 

I agree with this but calling it ""Patriarchy"" just isn't right. There is an outright denial of the very real and very tangible power that women hold and have always held.

>Patriarchy is the ideological societal belief that men are more suited to taking a dominant role - this doesn't even necessarily imply that they have more economic power; although this often ends up being a result.

Yes. It's an ideological belief. It cannot be proven. It also cannot be falsified.

>>When you frame the discussion as Men vs. Women, you are actively avoiding the real problem: Capitalism

>When you frame the problem as only being capitalism, you are actively avoiding several other problems, such as sexism, racism, homophobia and the state. If you are happily or deliberately avoiding any of these problems, then you're not really advocating for anarchism, or even egalitarianism.

Excuse me? How is blaming men for all of those things anything less than utter bigotry?

>Which brings me nicely to the reason that anarchists have such disdain for MRAs. We recognise the problems they recognise, and we want to tackle them too. To us, they are the ones framing the debate as ""Men vs Women"", as you say, and not as ""feminism vs patriarchy"", as we would.

We're not framing the debate. You are. You just did. Feminism is an analog for femininity as patriarchy is of masculinity. You've outright decided that women (and the rest of the world) are simply the victims of the white man's oppression. 

>The issues they raise, from our point of view, are all quite obviously caused by patriarchy and the gender roles it brings with it - but because of a misunderstanding of patriarchy and feminism (or in a few cases, latent misogynism), they choose to blame women and feminism, instead of the actual cause of their problem. 

Here's the thing. You saying we have a misunderstanding of patriarchy is like Donald Trump saying you just don't understand capitalism. It's rather arrogant. The MRA's that I've heard talking about it (myself included) have done their homework.

You are writing off our criticisms of your ideology. This is the exact same as a Christian telling me I don't understand their religion even though I was raised Roman Catholic.

>In doing so, they're actively fighting against the solution to their problems.

Until feminists are willing to entertain that their ideology is flawed, they are actively fighting against the solution to their problems. 

Dissident opinions are non-existenent in academic teachings of Patriarchy in Gender Studies courses. When an ideology is being taught in school that actively avoids considering the position of the opposition, it's nothing more than indoctrination. It's alienating and why so much furor is raised towards Feminism as a whole.

Now I am not going to say all MRAs have the same beliefs I do. I also accept that not all feminists ignore the gynocentrism that exists.

"You must be an idiot if it took you >120 hours to beat the latest version of LoD. Softcore on Battle.net with a group of friends? Maybe 60-70 hours to beat Hell. Ubers are a different story, but I don't consider them a separate difficulty so much as a bonus dungeon in end game. On top of that, you are comparing a game and its expansion to just one game. Compare D3 to regular D2 and then you're getting somewhere with your logic.

You are in an extreme minority in saying Inferno is easy. I'm not sure why real life comparisons are being drawn either. What do my personal hardships have anything to do with in game difficulty?

And 120 hours is insanely long for beating a game on the highest difficulty. I've played countless multiplayer games. D2 is not an MMORPG in any way, so comparisons can't be made there. It is also not specifically a multiplayer game, it just allows for co-op if you want it.

Since you drew the comparison between D3 length and other games (I am excluding MMO's because they aren't beatable, and including single player games because that's what Diablo is at its core) then let's have a look at the amount of time it takes to beat a game on the highest difficulty/~100% completion:

Final Fantasy 13 - <50 hours

Any FPS ever - <30 hours

Fable - <100 hours

Dungeon Siege 3 - <30 hours

Assassin's Creed 2 - <30 hours

Diablo 1 - <15 hours

Diablo 2 - <40 hours

Diablo 2: LoD - <80 hours

League of Legends - <100 hours (leveling up to 30)


I could go on for ages. 120 hours of gameplay from a 4-man team dedicated to beating the game with a lot of experience in the genre who work together, build properly and share loot? That's not fast in any way whatsoever. 

If they beat Inferno in under 80 hours, I would be impressed. I would tell you that yes, Inferno is clearly a piece of cake and I am just retarded for still being Act 3, or that your friends are among the gaming gods.

120 hours is by no means even close to ""fast"" for this game.

"> It's pretty true to be honest. The Orcs took very little convincing to commit genocide against the Draenei, even before they drank the kool aid. Duress is not a valid excuse for committing genocide either.

Ah yes, because the Draenei are totally innocent here. Never mind the fact that 2/3rd's of their population led by Archimonde and Kil'jaeden abused fel magics even more than the orcs did, and then made an attempt at manipulating a tribal race to be hostile to their escaped brethren. Blame the orcs for that!

> I mean the warchief that considers all the races as equally disposable. Sylvanas cares about literally no one but herself, and sees any and all of her subordinates as a shield to prevent her from getting what's coming to her (an eternity in Mega-Hell). She even steps over what she had previously considered a red line (raising Horde troops as undead) in BFA.

People need to stop bringing up this myth. Literally nobody knows what is coming to her. Or anyone for that matter. You could all be going to the same place, because where else is there to go? The vision she actually saw was watching her people being used as fodder without her there to protect them. She came back to prevent that from happening.

Why would she come back to prevent them from being made fodder, just to make them fodder? It's illogical. If she truly felt her troops were disposable how come she was the one who ordered the retreat at broken shore? How come she didn't leave anyone behind to cover her escape?

> Genn had due cause to attack Sylvanas, considering that he was acting on intel the Alliance PC recovers in Azsuna. She was also extremely close to alienating Odyn to the point where he may not have even handed over the Aegis of Aggramar at all, demanding some impossible trial, like ""bring me the head of Sargeras"".

Rofl no he didn't. His ""intel"" amounted to nothing more than ""Hey the forsaken are totally interested in something at X location"" He had no idea what they were doing. He goes in and attacks his allies pretty much blind because he's a paranoid moron. What is the worst that could happen? She can make some extra Valk'yre. Oh noooo! Considering how at this point she was still an ally to the alliance... what's the issue here?

Alienating Odyn? He's not very bright or good himself. He murdered and enslaved his daughters to make the first Valk'yre then brainwashed the mortals that worship him to fight and die for his causes. He knows the fate of the universe is on the balance and continues to demand pointless trials for his amusement. He's not all that powerful and if he ever became a problem to Azeroth he would just be a raid boss we'd actually get to kill, instead of just being a raid boss we have to bring to near death.

> I also mean humans. Arathor, the very first Human kingdom that antedated the Alliance completely, fought alongside Quel'thalas in the Troll Wars.

So let me get this straight. You hate how the bloodelves blame the entire alliance for the actions of Garithos alone.

But you think Garithos is justified for the actions against an entire race, for the choices of their elven leader abandoning an alliance which clearly didn't have the interests of his people in mind.

"here's my personal story/take on it. My parents chose to have sex when they were ready for children. Now, with raging hormones teenagers have growing up, it's ridiculously hard to say no to sex before you're ready for children.

So, I was born 3 months early, struggled with health complications from day one. Now, I've been fortunate enough to be pretty active and capable of ""normal"" living. But more than 20 years ago when I was born, the doctors were very unsure what my life would be like and if i'd even live that long. If I did live, some thought I may not ever walk.

It doesn't. It cannot and never will. No one in communist nations really gets paid at all.

"I don't think I've ever met a black woman who consider ""straight and flowing as a European"" ideal for their hair, though I don't doubt it's the case in some places. 

But used as a basis to make braiding easier and for traditional ""black"" hairstyles, it is used as a basis for hairstyles that 1) in many cases, particularly braiding, has a history that pre-dates widespread contact between Europe and Africa by hundreds of years, 2) to a large extent is based on elaborate styling that explicitly avoids ""straight and flowing"" and that doesn't resemble European hairstyles at all.

In many places you will find weaves are looked down upon exactly because it is seen as the most similar to European hairstyles.

Now, there's little doubt that historically relaxing was used to some extent to look more European (which I also specifically mentioned), but the historical basis for the current popularity of relaxing is pretty clear. 

Books have been written on the subject (we have a couple - my wife cares deeply about her hair, it's a big part of her heritage and can go on about it for hours). 

The resurgence has largely come as expressing black identity in countries like the US and Britain has become more and more decoupled from a need to express a tie, however remote, to Africa

At the same time, urban black hairstyling has been exported back to Africa. My wife is Nigerian, and a large part of the hairstyles that she and her friends make use of were imported from the US. However to claim any of them look like ""white"" hairstyles would be outright silly.

> As a black woman who does not relax her hair I'd have to disagree with the breakage and the tangling part. My natural hair is way longer than my when my hair was relaxed because the harsh chemicals caused a lot of breakage.

You confuse two separate issues. If relaxing is done badly, yes, it will cause breakage, and may also cause burns and eventually bald spots. However, once the hair is relaxed, the result is stronger as the number of stress points in the hair are reduced. 

This is why relaxing the hair today is generally an integral part of preparing for braids and weaves, at least when done by someone remotely professional, even when the natural hair is completely covered and it so isn't necessary for aesthetic reasons at all. 

Whenever my wife is pressed for time she may get braids done without relaxing her hair, but if so, she always ""pays for it"" by taking the braids out much sooner than usual exactly for this reason - the hair starts breaking far sooner and easier under stress in that case.

That's a difficult one to argue. I doubt JR's apparent certainty that he saw a fire on the Monday, mainly because of evidence from other reports that cast doubt on their impartiality. It also doesn't seen to add up to me, that he distinctly recalls a large fire on the Monday at 4:30pm, yet all the other initial witnesses, who were only meters away, make no mention of any fire. Now I would argue, that approach is rational and based on the evidence. However, because I believe Avery is innocent, my approach is considered proof of confirmation bias, therefore of no merit whatsoever, unless I changed my opinion to conclude there was a fire and that Avery is guilty. Do you see my problem? 

>I am clearly following an order and evaluating all data points. I have been very clear with you as to why I show lower confidence in certain data points and therefore apply less weight.

Like you, somethings I will give more weight to than others, although I don't consider any ""data points"" in isolation, but will attempt to see where they fit into the bigger picture, thereby allowing me to be a bit more precise as to what importance I might give them.

>You seem to have a whole different set of weight that you place on someone giving two different accounts of the same time/event. Confirmation bias can get you there imo.

With regard to two different accounts, I would generally accept someone first account as being the most reliable.

>You also want me to accept that Avery simply accepted there was a fire because everyone else said so. Fair to say that. However, I think the opposing argument of him admitting it, because others noticed it, is possibly more likely.

That argument is again based on the fact there WAS a fire on the Monday, which if you accept that, I would agree he might have had to admit there was one, because others noticed it. It what you don't seem to have considered, was what if there WASN'T a fire on the Monday. How does that all all fit? Initially, the only suggestion there was, is JR's account. It wasn't recorded, nor do we know when the report was actually written. You seem to have placed all your faith in that one report, to conclude there was a fire, even though we have at least seven people who initially make no mention of a fire. So why do you give 100% credit to one account, but 0% credit to seven accounts? If you did consider there was no fire Monday, then what would Steve and Brendan have done? Exactly, not mention a fire.

>What you don't see is me at times arguing YOUR side of the equation. Why do I do this? Because I am ok with questioning my own beliefs and I'm not trying to confirm a bias, but rather just evaluate the probability of either side. I make no conclusion. 

Not strictly true. You conclude there was a fire Monday, therefore conclude Avery and Dassey intentionally concealed that fact, to give one example. 

>You on the other hand? you've made a conclusion and are trying to change a mind that is not made up, but just plainly is playing devils advocate to yours.

This is not going well, as I disagree with you again! I made an argument that Dassey hadn't been coached, based in part from information that was know, but you concluded he had been. That's not playing devil's advocate as I see it.

That is putting the cart before the horse.

The problem with that attitude is that it is short sighted.

It leads to freemium games that have zero respect for the gamer's time and space.

Second, what is a game? If it isn't fun, then guess what, your game isn't going to sell.

Third, you do realize that fun and making money are not mutually exclusive right?

All the best games and most popular games started by being fun; not after the fact. No good game designer went ""Let's design a game solely make to money, oh, and by the way we guess we should make sure it is fun too."" That is corporate suicide.

Begs the question. Nothing in the gospels can be considered historical. The gospels say a lot about what some people believed about Jesus.

"> If you take out the gas taxes provided by suburban commuters, how do you propose that we maintain our highway infrastructure? You do realize that the highway network is a significant economic and military advantage for the United States?

Well I never suggested eliminating suburban commuters (or rural people who have to drive 30 miles to get to the nearest hardware store, also contributing to gas tax revenues). I suggested that we enact policies that would reduce subsidies on those lifestyles, marginally increasing their cost. This alteration in incentives would lead some people to choose to live more urban lives, and would slightly shift the demographic balance so that a greater proportion of people live in urban areas. If you want to live a suburban or rural lifestyle, that's your prerogative, but it has high costs for the state and you should have to bear more of those costs versus them being borne by the general tax fund.

Higher gas taxes and/or tolls could generate plenty of revenue to run our highway system. I provided the evidence that less than 50% of highway spending is recovered in gas taxes and tolls, I just think that this should be a higher number.

> All this would do is shift the congestion from the highways to public transit. Have you seen public transit in places like Beijing and Tokyo? Not exactly a relaxing commute to work when you're packed in like sardines.

I think that is partially cultural. They are culturally conditioned to be used to more cramped spaces and closer contact with other people. They don't see it as a big deal. You look at other very popular transit systems in New York and Europe and they don't have that issue, people wouldn't stand for it and its an easily solved problem.

> This is really a very minor issue and you are significantly overstating its benefits. Anyone who buys a home simply for the MID is a fool who has no business buying in the first place. For instance, the total interest spent on our mortgage this year was about $6500. In the 15% marginal tax bracket, that means that our deduction is worth less than $1000 this year That's enough to cover the costs of our HOI and garbage collection for the year. Not exactly a huge sum of money. And its benefit goes down each year (unless we get bumped into a higher tax bracket).

$1,000 is still an appreciable amount of money. Again, I'm just talking about at the margin. You get rid of the home interest deduction, you get rid of some of the highway subsidies, you allow for more attractive schooling options in the city, there were already the city benefits of needing fewer car(s) and having lower energy bills, and all the sudden a few more people who were already on the fence about where they wanted to live have decided to move into the city. If reducing subsidies on suburban living shifted only 5% to 10% of the current suburban and rural population into urban areas, that would have a big effect. It would decrease energy prices for everyone, decrease oil imports, and improve the national balance sheet.

> The current system works well because the individuals who most benefit from upgrades and expansion plans are the ones who foot the bill for it.

I would argue very much against the idea that the current system works well. At least it doesn't work well for a lot of poor kids. But like I said, vouchers are a way to solve the urban education problem that I was referencing without even really taking on the issue of education for the poor. You have a voucher system and people can spend the money to send their kids to whatever school they want.

> Namely crime, pollution, noise, lack of nature, etc.

These are AMERICAN urban problems, which I believe are symptomatic of 50 years of policy that subsidized wealthier people to move out into the suburbs. If you look at europe, the downtown urban cores of the cities are desirable places for the wealthy to live and its the poor who live out in the suburbs. Pollution, too, it depends on what you mean. Yeah there's probably more litter per square mile in the city, but there's more insecticide and fertilizer runoff in the farmlands.

Of course there are personal preferences. I'm just saying that we shouldn't subsidize suburban living so much. ",1

"Here's the thing about historical and cultural knowledge. It is more or less irrlevant, because of the claims made within the bible. 

In 2 Timothy 3:16 the bible claims ""All scripture is god-breathed and is useful for teaching, reproof, correction and training in righteousness."" What this means is that every single word in the bible (according to the bible) is meant to be used for, well, teaching, reproof, correction and training in righteousness. It doesn't go on to clarify in this specific time period, to this specific culture and in this particular context only. God is is supposedly omniscient and according to the words that he allegedly wrote, everything that he wrote was meant for a purpose. A truly omniscient god wouldn't make a claim like this unless he also believed it to be valid outside of the particular culture and historical background of the time. 

Also, the bible has an extremely, and I do mean extremely, tenuous grasp of history and what actually happened in these time periods it references, so the historical context for a lot of it is bullshit because of that.

"I can tell you put a lot of effort into it, but I do not find your argument compelling. I will try to put just as much effort into my post as you have in yours. I have tried to be polite and keep my emotions out of it, but some of your comments rubbed me the wrong way so I apologize if some of my frustration seeped through and manifested itself as rudeness. I am not trying to flame you. Here's the issues I have with your post:

>People get uptight with her tendency to screw with her friends and be lazy / cocky, but that is similar to how I act around my closest friends. I am a pretty nice guy and would help my friends with almost anything they ask, but that doesnt mean I cant have a little fun at their expense once in a while.

Do you crash into your friends, knocking them into the mud and probably causing them from physical pain, and then just laugh and NOT EVEN APOLOGIZE like RD does in episode one? Didn't think so. There is a difference between having fun at someone's expense (Pinkie does this all the time and no one hates her for it) and being an inconsiderate asshole. And no, it's not ""uptight"" to not want your friend to physically injure you, get your coat all dirty, and then laugh about it and say ""no need to thank me"" like she did you a favor. In what way is this ""tiny"" or ""lovable"" as you call it? I would never befriend someone who treated me this way.

You say she doesn't use magic, but all ponies are magical in their own way. Pegasis flight is a magical ability, just like Earth ponies' ability to grow food is magical. Magical wing or magical horn, magic is magic. I can't see a pony going Mach 10 and magic not being a factor.

You say that she is the most awesome because she ""is able to accomplish feats that literally no one else in the entire land can accomplish."" To this I say, so what? Pinkie Pie is the only pony that can sense the future. In fact, she's faster than RD. Twilight Sparkle is the only pony who could soothe Ursa Minor. Fluttershy is the only pony who has control over butterflies. When it comes to mane 6 ponies, there is nothing about being able to accomplish unique feats that separates her from the rest of the pack.

You say that Celestia might have had a different apprentice, but Celestia values leadership qualities more than magical talent. I think you misunderstand the reasons for her choice of student. Rainbow Dash would NOT make a good leader. For sake of convenience, I will take an example from the most recent episode. In Power Ponies, while Twilight tries to help Spike with his insecurities by saying ""well at least you aren't Humdrum"" Rainbow Dash says something like ""just stand back and leave it to us,"" NOTICEABLY hurting Spike's feelings. This kind of unhelpful attitude is always causing turbulence within the group, and she would make a bad princess because of these traits regardless of her magical talent. Furthermore, you overestimate RD's focus. Even with immense magical talent, RD is too bored by the idea of studying spells to nurture magical talent, whereas Twilight is the opposite way.

You say that Rarity seems to have a bigger ego than RD. I think this is very biased. Again, using just the last episode as an example, we can find a scene in which Rainbow Dash is bragging, whereas there is no scene of Rarity bragging. This is not an exception; it is the trend. No one cares if her brags are true. They care that she brags.

>If she is only saying uplifting things about herself and not putting others down, I can't comprehend how others can see this as a way she is being rude / disrespectful.

I can't comprehend how you don't see her as rude The entire episode Dragonshy is basically her complaining about Fluttershy, with rude/disrespectful lines such as ""not YOUR fault [angry scowl at Fluttershy]"" and saying ""Still think it was a good idea to bring Fluttershy along?"" with an obvious angry and sarcastic tone. In Princess Twilight Sparkle, when AJ fails to pull the vines off the Tree of Harmony, I am pretty sure RD is being rude and sarcastic when she says ""nice try,"" because she sounds like she has a tone there too and the facial language makes it look like she is making fun of AJ. I know there is a much better example, because I SPECIFICALLY remember a scene where Twi is trying to give pep-talk and RD says something counterproductive and hurtful to another pony's feelings and Twi yells ""RAINBOW DASH!,"" but I can't remember the episode right now. I'll edit my post if I remember. I deliberately didn't use MMDW as an example, but there are probably examples in there too.

You say that ""it's all true"" and ""On top of that, pretty much everything she says is the truth. Its not like she cant do the things she boasts about."" How can you think this? It's simply not true. Again, using only the most recent episodes, in Daring Do she brags that she is ""the series' biggest fan,"" and it is obvious from the scene that Twilight is a bigger fan than her. RD brags about nearly everything because she thinks she is the best at almost everything. It seems like you might have selective memory and avoid remembering the ways Rainbow Dash is arrogant, as this is a very clear-cut and dry example that the writers have spoon-fed us to show how RD is unjustified in her arrogance. If a professional gamer says he is the best soccer player in the world, and he clearly isn't, I will not think he is awesome. Rainbow Dash is no different for thinking she is the biggest fan of a series when she isn't even up to date on the release of the next book in the series.

Not what I meant. Alpha is the initial implementation of all the key features and mechanics for the game, and beta is when the majority of the polish, bug fixing, and fine tuning comes into play. During alpha, bug fixing is not a priority. 

Of course, different studios follow different cycles, but this seems to be the cycle that Bohemia Interactive seems to be following.

In case you don't want to click the link, here's how the abstract begins: ""For centuries, the colonial governments used a combination of race and ethnic characteristics to subjugate and control people of color, and scientists of the day provided evidence of the ""natural order of things"" to support national policies of domination, segregation and control. There have been many examples of events in the past 70 years to suggest that achievements by ethnic peoples are not genetically determined and that race and ethnicity are merely terms to describe external features, language, culture, social mores and folklore.""

That's what a statistical map is. That's what statistics itself is. Based on your logic, the very sentence ""24% of inhabitants of Estonia are ethnic Russians"" creates a false picture because it is based on an average over the whole country.

What you are saying is that every statistical map ever creates a false picture. I don't think you quite understand the concept of a statistical map.

Because the symbol allows a much finer resolution. And I don't have any agenda.

There has to be some cut-off point. 10% is a reasonable cut-off point for recent minorities.

As does every statistical map ever.

> A map is not supposed to do that for god's sake...

The map is based on purely geographical criteria because¡ªusing the symbols according to their resolution¡ªbecause, as you rightly noted, that is the point of the map. However, if it creates a correct impression of the overall size if the minority, that's an added bonus.

A map is supposed to convey information with geographically distributed symbols. People will subconsciously judge the size based on how much is covered; there's no question about that.

If the minority were visually overrepresented (e.g. when a reader would think, based on the map, that 50% of Estonians are Russians), then we could debate that maybe the methodology should change in the case of Estonia to avoid this. But the minority is visually unerrepresented (looks smaller than it is) when the normal mathematically sound methodology is applied.

There's evidence against the existence of an all-powerful, all-knowing, all-loving creator god, yes, but that proof isn't really necessary, because the claim that god exists doesn't even get close to meeting the burden of proof.

> As it is right now, whether there is life or not is a yes or no question, and we have found nothing.

There already is life, so it's a yes. The question is, ""Is earth the only place in the entire universe where there is life?"" and the answer to that question is, ""Possibly, but it seems highly unlikely.""

> We know of the conditions needed for life to emerge from various experiments. We know then that Earth had all those conditions because we have life. But you can't say that a planet has all those conditions just by calculating their distance from their star. Earth-like conditions don't guarantee hospitality to life.

I never said that it ""guarantees"" hospitality.

No, I think that the evidence suggests that there probably is, but I wouldn't feel safe saying, ""Yes, there definitely is life.""

Uh, he is physically resisting arrest. His height and weight are VERY relevant. How do you know he's not stronger than three cops combined? What if he's as strong as three cops? Even if he wasn't he still could inflict some serious damage. Why should they risk that when they are allowed to use physical force? Unless he intended to kill him, he was trying to save his fellow officers from potentially getting hurt and quickly gain control. Perfectly legal.

Dexterity contributes to damage, and also defense. I always specced dagger rogues 18 cunning, 16 constitution and everything else to dexterity. Doing this will ensure that your rogues never get hit by melee (until you get to golems of ammalammadingdong). Rogues should use daggers. Swords are strength-based, and you will miss all the time, or just have weak damage, or spec all str....and not be able to dodge anything.

Mages are for haste. You can have them cast offensive or heal spells as well, but you need to set tactics up carefully, or they will run out of mana and cancel haste....which is bad. They should also run a weapon augment spell like fire weapons or telekinetic weapons.

I suggest you set mages up to run haste, and telekenetic weapons, and then cast 1-2 spells with cooldowns. Crushing prison is a great one, as well as cold snap. then jsut have them staff attack to avoid their dropping weapon augs and haste.

In the base game, rogues cannot benefit from double haste, but warriors can. If you run two mages, you will want your powerhouse damage machine to be a warrior who dual wields swords or axes. you will want to run precision, because that will slow down normal attach speed, and allow for 2x haste (100% attack speed) to equate to a number between 1 and 2. The issue is that the game sees 200% as equal to 100%.

Archery is awesome once you get (dammit I forget) Arrow of slaying (I think). Archer is the only means I am aware of in which the game can be completed nightmare-solo.

">How much overlap do you think there is in the readers of sites like Tumblr and Buzzfeed, and people who actually should be lectured about feminists issues?

Quite a lot. This is why I think it's useful because readers of buzzfeed can start to have a little more feminism brought up to them on the regular. Some will choose to look deeper into feminism which only helps. Some will continue to hold the same beliefs they had before reading an article, no harm no foul. Some may twist around something that they read and make incorrect assumptions but as I've stated multiple times there isn't enough factual information in these articles to actually be mislead about anything concrete. But if someone is mislead it's easy enough to correct because buzzfeed is very general by nature.

"> Why is his character now above killing superman who he admits has the potential to wipe out everyone on earth if he desired. 

You'll note that he never expresses any of this to Clark. He's learned his lesson from his villains and he keeps the villain monologue short, and here's what he says: 

> I bet your parents taught you that you're special. That you mean something. My parents taught me a different lesson, dying in the gutter for no reason at all: the world only makes sense when you force it to."" 

Aside from being a sick pull from The Dark Knight Returns, it's also a bit of insight into Bruce's real motivation here: he wants to prove he can still make a difference. This was never about Superman; it was about Bruce's helplessness when a bunch of immortal aliens showed up. The first thing the movie shows us is he day he decided to become Batman. The second thing it shows us is the day he decides to kill Superman. They are very much related to his inability to act in either situation. He's this great crimefighter, having bested who even knows how many villains in his twenty years, but once the Black Zero showed up, that was it. His goose was cooked. It was only because Superman showed up that the day was saved. So Batman did what we all do and rationalized and made excuses and focused his hate until 

> Bruce doesn't stop kicking Superman's head in because he recognizes humanity, he does it because they have mothers with the same name, hence the flashback to the scene with his own mother. 

You mean until he flashes back to the moment where his own father's last thought in this mortal plane was for his wife? As he prepares to deal the killing blow to this man that he knows, on some level, is a good person trying to do the right thing? And he sees this person, this alien freak call out a woman's name, knowing it's the last thing he'll ever say. Just like his father, so many years ago. 

And then bam it's that Pulitzer winner from that newspaper! ""It's his mother's name! It's his mom, homie, chill!!"" and oh my god it all comes together. That little millennial piece of shit Lex Luthor kidnapped this dork's mom (he has a mom? a girlfriend??) forced him to come fight (oh my god he even said ""Lex wants us fight"" how fucking stupid am I?!) and is probably using us as a distraction for something else. He must have been behind the Senate bombing so I can't even imagine what he's up to now oh Jesus oh Christ we need to do something get up, dork!! 

That entire scene makes perfect sense to me, and if you want to twist facts to make it about the sheer coincidence of their mothers both having the same name, I can't stop you, but it doesn't change the narrative's sequence of events. Sorry. 

Speaking of narrative sequence of events: 

> The movie would have to have Bruce make some turn where he recognizes the sanctity of life or acknowledges his ways have become more jaded and he needs to return to a more fair system of judgement. I can say neither of these things happen cause he then precedes to slaughter guys in that compound to get Clark's mom back. 

You and I have very different definitions of slaughter. Let's go over this scene again: he approaches a band of elite mercenaries who are using military-grade weaponry in an urban environment. One of them fires at him with a powerful minigun, so he takes a second-- taking fire-- lines up his shot-- still taking fire-- begins to shoot at the ground in front of the merc-- still taking fire-- crawls his fire toward the merchant, giving him plenty of time to just jump out and run away-- still taking fire-- and then finally blows the truck up underneath him. Explain to me what Batman did that was morally wrong. Would a cop or a soldier have been wrong to ""slaughter"" this man in that way? Then, Batman enters a room with ""two dozen [armed] hostiles"" without even a gun. Yeah, he probably killed a couple of them (looking at you, crate guy whose head magically starts gushing blood in the Ultimate Edition), but they got off easy. SWAT or, hell, the Punisher would have just fucking killed everyone. Batman literally showed them mercy by merely putting most of them in the hospital. And yeah, maybe he was cruel for eye-for-an-eye'ing the guy that stabbed him (poor criminal mercenary ) but he sure did mess up that perfect Bruce Wayne blood sample that guy had just created. Then he shoots the tank of the flamethrower a guy was about to use to cook a Midwestern mom alive with. 

What a fucking monster. 

Damn man it is super hard to take these complaints seriously. 

By the way, his turn doesn't happen until after Superman dies. He helps save Martha because it's a pretty good apology to Superman, but also because he has already begun to swallow his pride and realizes that only Superman will have a chance of containing whatever Luthor is cooking up in that ship. The actual change of heart comes later, though, when he doesn't maim Lex Luthor, who absolutely deserves to have that bat branded into his fucking face. But Batman walks a different path now. 

He has rejected the ""beautiful lie.""

In what context? The market as an acting force is made up of people who have no interest in pursuing objectivity - by its very nature, individual actors within the market will act entirely within their own frame of reference (i.e. subjectively). 

Worse, the amount of influence that each actor has is proportional both to their assets and to their willingness to influence the market, while their intent has almost no impact on their ability to influence the market.

You portray ""the market"" as some kind of democratic system, or as being a representation of what people really want, but it's as far away from that as possible.

Revelation 22:8-9 (New World Translation)
I [John] fell down to proskyne¨­ before the feet of the angel that had been showing me these things. 9 But he tells me: ¡°Be careful! Do not do that! All I am is a fellow slave of you and of your brothers who are prophets and of those who are observing the words of this scroll. proskyne¨­ God.¡±

Revelation 5:13-14 (New World Translation)
13 And every creature that is in heaven and on earth and underneath the earth and on the sea, and all the things in them, I heard saying: ¡°To the One sitting on the throne and to the Lamb be the blessing and the honor and the glory and the might forever and ever.¡± 14 And the four living creatures went saying: ¡°Amen!¡± and the elders fell down and proskyne¨­.


It's the exact same word every time. Look at Revelation 7 (New World Translation)

>And all the angels were standing around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell upon their faces before the throne and proskyne¨­ God, 12 saying: ¡°Amen! The blessing and the glory and the wisdom and the thanksgiving and the honor and the power and the strength [be] to our God forever and ever. Amen.¡±


Whatever they're doing, it should only be done to God (22:9), it is done to God (7:11), and it is done to God and Jesus simultaneously (5:14). There is no getting around it. 5:14 is not simple honor any more than 7:11 is, it's worship, and the Father shares his worship with Jesus.


The same is true of Revelation 22:13. The Alpha and Omega who is speaking is the one who is coming quickly in verse 12, and that is Jesus. It's not difficult to conclude, it's easy.

I do have a right to exist where my friends are.

She rallied undead who regained free will.

She not only retook Capital City from the Scourge itself (clearly defining an opposition to the Lich King), but had one demon leader slay another.

Killing Garithos was at the very least, a way to secure the land for herself. If that's ""Lich King"" esque, then so is King Thoradin who united the human tribes to form the kingdom of Arathor to begin with.

> Were they? Because that's an assumption. No written material outright states that the Forsaken and the other races of the Horde were under the impression that Varimathras had proven his loyalty.

No written material outrights states that the Forsaken and other races of the Horde weren't under that impression.

So, it can either be spelled out explicitly, or the minor leap of ""One of the faction leaders of the Horde has a dreadlord advisor"" to ""Guess that dreadlord advisor has to be vetted, somehow.""

What help they could have provided Lordaeron, they already had. We know reinforcements were sent at least from the dwarves. People will have ignored Lordaeron because the largest group of resistance (Garithos') had fallen.

> I'm criticizing the fact that she isn't considering possible imminent attacks, and acts as if she had an invulnerable plot armor surrounding her, sending envoys out to the Alliance and the Horde.

This is a ludicrous criticism. She sent envoys precisely because she knew she was vulnerable.

This is not a difficult concept.

> I don't see how Othmar Garithos has a place in this epistemologic process.

The quote: 

> could be under immediate attack anytime soon and instead her only choice of action to forge allegiances is sending envoys

Implies that Sylvanas had burned bridges by slaying a representative of the Alliance -- Garithos -- when she did. And that is arguably the case. Diplomatic ties with the Alliance should have been easier if Garithos were kept alive.

If that wasn't what was being referred to, then sure, Garithos is irrelevant.

> Peace accord? Did she have a peace accord with the Alliance?

> I don't think she did.

> She might have ended up with a peace accord after joining the Horde, but that's not the timeframe I'm addressing in the suggestion you're rebutting.

It was a misspeak.

It would be nonsensical for the Forsaken to attack the Alliance in order to befriend the Horde when the Horde had a tenuous pact with the Alliance at this time.

> Your remark implies that people can only show concern by one thing at a time. I don't think that's how quality writing goes.

Explain why Sylvanas would be a concern, then.

If it's because she has a dreadlord advisor, that's simply not good enough. Especially when it's quite possible that the Alliance don't even know if it was her hand that took Garithos' life (well, Varimathras', but under her command).

> Because a handful of actions in a very small timeframe is enough to deem a demon-commander of the Burning Legion loyal.

Slaying one of your ""brothers"" in front of your new warchief was deemed enough of an act.

Perception of loyalty is subjective. Do not act as if Sylvanas was ""objectively wrong"" to have believed that to be enough. As quality writing goes, characters have their own views. Sylvanas' view was that Varimathras had done enough.

> That writing direction is a poor excuse to handwave the Forsaken into a playable faction and makes no sense when everyone is suddenly Varimathras and nobody is questioning how much everyone is trusting him out of nowhere.

Again, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

In other words, there is no canon stating that anyone was oblivious to Varimathras. So there is no cause (or sense, frankly) in assuming they were.

> Even if he worked to deserve said trust, his work is minimal. 

This is completely subjective.

> Not even worthy of a position of military leadership (he commands the Forsaken forces in Vanilla and even hands out missions) in any realistic world.

In any... realistic world.

Well, then.

> Think on any work that portrays a strong military force, and then imagine one of the enemy army's generals switching sides and being put in a position of utmost power after nothing but a handful of actions that don't even harm his previous faction.

You've missed the important point that everyone else but the Burning Legion on Azeroth knew that Mal'Ganis was not truly dead.

Nor did they have a real grasp of the Legion's true strength.

They were led to believe -- because nathrezim are indeed devious -- that the dreadlords' defeat was a significant one for the Legion. In a way, it was; the Legion desires Azeroth very much and they lost control over their Scourge in the Eastern Kingdoms following this. But of course it was not as significant as Varimathras let on, even conjuring up that ""rule"" about never slaying another nathrezim.

> The humans used ships to sail to Theramore. Survivors of Lordaeron. You'd think they would be more than willing to sail back to Lordaeron in a campaign to kick out the actual weakened ruler.

After having recently fought at the Battle of Mount Hyjal, finding new land to settle (because Lordaeron is ravaged by this point), and not wanting to deal with the Scourge that remains? Scourge, not just Forsaken.

Stop ignoring that point.

> Go back to #4, up above, where you just mentioned Garithos.

> She is weakened, but ignores the possibility of imminent attacks.

No she doesn't. Read Volume III. She is desperate. It literally says ""desperate for allies."" Why else if not because she is under pressure? She certainly is from the Scarlet Crusade, that much is also explicitly stated.

Read the book.

> Ironically they do make an effort about being hyper specific about Anveena Teague, the Red Pox, the Gorian Empire and the breakers, primals and colossals.

If you think they were being hyper specific about Anveena or the Red Pox, you are gravely mistaken.

The history of Draenor on the other hand, was not previously covered well at all in other media. This is largely because it wasn't so developed. Chronicle Volume II elucidates plenty about the history of the world, including confirming that the Titans (well, a Titan) did indeed stumble upon it and order it.

Contrast that to these Warcraft III events -- which are often depicted in game -- and there's a clear reason for the ""hyperspecificity"".

> ""their"" in the phrase ""their concerns"" refers to the ""nations of Azeroth"" in the above point 1.)

And the Horde and its nations are included in that. Their concerns were clearly expressed within the book.

And at this moment, I conclude that you're doing nothing more than attempting to be belligerent.

This discussion is going to go nowhere. You're clearly set in your opinion, so I'll leave it at that. You clearly misunderstand many elements described within the book, despite them being (quite clearly) stated. Yet you want more to be stated.

"> I hate to sound like a dick, but you pretty much answered your own point. Cloud is a superhuman. Also, I'm gonna advise you to go replay the game because everything in FF7 was extremely hyperbolic by nature.

You don't sound like a dick. Also I have played FF7 at least 10 times since it came out in the 90's and as recently as a few months ago. Again, I think the things you're talking about have more to do with the cartoony, limited medium the game was working with and the type of game it was. This is a different story telling medium. Yes Cloud is a superhuman. But he's still a human and there are limitations to his own abilities. Like I said earlier, Sephiroth pulling off these feats made TOTAL sense to me. He imbued with powers from an alien monster to a ridiculous degree. Again, the physics in the Tifa fight? Totally down for that. She's the greatest martial artist in their world who uses magic. I can see her managing to cling to a wall with momentum for a few seconds and jump several feat in the air. She's a beast. I also think Cloud should be able to jump MUCH higher than her and should be much stronger than her.

I don't think the physics should be 100% realistic. It's a fantasy story. I just think they should have been ""a little more grounded"". Or at LEAST more consistent. Having consistency does not cause everything to fall apart. In fact it's quite the opposite. If your story's world lacks consistency in ANY aspect, it can fall apart. Ask any professional writer. Why didn't Cloud just JUMP up to Shinra tower on disc one instead of climbing up the support structures. Why didn't he JUMP out of the Gold Saucer Prison? In fact, being able to jump THAT high, why didn't he just JUMP everywhere? On a side note, out of all the Final Fantasy games, VII is the most grounded and realistic, relatively speaking, I think. Which is one of the reasons it's so successful.

>This is a film, not a game.

Exactly. The Medium MATTERS.

> There is not enough run time to appease everyone. Rather they focus on the main character, and touch on the others briefly. They handled it well, and I'm happy.

Right, which is why you don't try to. When you do, as I mentioned earlier, that's called pandering and it takes away from the story. I wouldn't have had a problem with them touching on the characters. I personally just feel the way they did it was over the top. In honesty, I would have MUCH rather they had found a way to work those characters into the story itself much more than I would prefer they cut them. But having them show up for 2 minutes all at once just in time to stop Sephiroth was just too much for me.

> As also a fan of story structure and characters, just cause they weren't the focus, doesn't mean they should be omitted entirely, they still play important roles. An IP like FF7 would have received tremendous flack for not including those characters either way. So it was a lose-lose cause someone was bound to complain regardless of how they chose to go about it.

They all did play important roles in the game. Not in this film. In fact the only main characters who had any real relevence were Cloud, Tifa, Aerith and to an extent Vincent. I actually studied screen writing for a time earlier on in my life (I'm only saying this to note where my info comes from). One of the first rules of writing a film is: if its not pivotal to the plot or character development, cut it. I love those characters, but they were not important to that particular self-contained story.

1) We've got the largest military in the world, by far. And Mr. Trump want's to expand that so we can fight 2 wars on two continents. This is the fallacy of the next war will be like the last war.

The next war, was this election where Russian Trolls swamped the internet. We need an increase in cyber capability.

But, my point is, Repubs always terrify you about the debt, it's a big number, and then go and blow the debt up with outrageous defense spending. Debt: 1) Military spending, and 2) Depressions, where the social safety net gets used a lot. ( Food Stamps ).

So, you may have become convinced that the debt was Obama's fault. Well, he's still cleaning up Bush's debt Tsunami.
Obama paid the Food Stamp bill, but Bush (R) made that bill necessary. And Obama's paying the VA, veterans administration, bill, but Bush made that bill necessary to pay.

Apropos the 'especially racist for his time' claim, that is so popular these days: What is the basis of this claim? That some modern novelist said so in a blog post? That Joshi once said so? 

Compare what Lovecraft said with what his contemporaries said and¡ªmore importantly¡ªDID.
Have a look at this for historical context:
 http  In case you don't know, Lovecraft lived from 1890 to 1937. 

Now, nobody would dispute that Lovecraft was no fan of multiculturalism. However, the actual severity of his racism compared to others of his time is greatly exaggerated on a regular basis. 

Lovecraft's biological racism was mostly confined to black people. These views, of course, are deplorable. However, it is important to know that they mostly reflected the science of his time. When judging Lovecraft, you may also want to note that Lovecraft expressedly says in one of his letters that he would be the last person to wish black people any harm. Let us be honest: Seen within the context of his time, this sentiment alone would be enough to dismiss your claim. Racist: Yes. Especially racist for his time: No.

By insisting that Lovecraft was especially racist for his time, essentially, what you are doing is to deny an inglorious chapter of Western history: Large parts of the American (and European) public held similar views. You are using Lovecraft as a scapegoat.

Because a little while before the US Constitution was written Europe had gone through a series of nasty religious wars that saw a lot of people dead and the kind of no compromise, anything goes, God is on our side and we can do no wrong nastiness that religious wars seem to foster.

So Jefferson, Madison, and the rest of the boys, being quite educated and up on their (relatively recent) history decided that in the US there would be no official US religion, and the government could not hinder or interfere with anyone's religion in any way shape or form. It's in writing:

Fair enough. I was just talking off the top of my head. To expand on the prof's point, archaeologists tend to assume that anything big and monumental was built by a state. This can become quite tautological.

Another separate point is that big, monumental forms of infrastructure might actually be a stupid idea in the first place.

>Also, regarding terminology, ""commodifying"" things is basically about giving them a value, so that they can be traded as a commodity.

Right, giving them a monetary value. But what is the value of a commodity? Does steel get it's value from its extrinsic worth? Or does it have a social value as a resource? A ceramic cup might only be valued at a few dollars, but its social value is measured in its ability to hold liquid for consumption. This is the crux of what I'm trying to get it: I don't care what a crypto currency is valued in trade, in which instance it becomes just another financial tool, a bourgeois means of extracting capital.

Well directed action: While some of the action in FF7 I found a bit hard to follow at times, the series has maintained large scale action on a cohesive level.

Compare it to a scene from Transformers 2, where there could be some great action going on, but is nearly incomprehensible due to how it's filmed and edited. Fast and Furious 3, 5 and 6 especially really upped their game in both stakes and relativity in how stunts are choreographed and action is displayed. It's fun that can be followed.

The fact that you have to resort to an absolutely ridiculous hypothetical to refute the philosophy attests to the strength of the philosophy.

The market system prevents one armed force from becoming superior to all other armed forces combined. Even if you disagree with this premise, the conclusions ancaps draw from this premise can still be valid conclusions if the premise is assumed true. I think that the communist premise that workers are exploited is complete and utter nonsense, but that doesn't necessarily make communists' arguments derived from that premise are invalid logical reasoning. More often than not, the majority of an argument is logically consistent, and it is either the premise or one crucial step in the logical chain that brings down otherwise correct arguments.

The poor person might get compensated fairly quickly for an injustice done to them and the prosecutor would have an incentive to get as much restitution as he could, thus punishing the perpetrator. So there might be more of a deterrent to preying on the poor, and the poor would be more likely to collect restitution, in an AnCap society than in today's society.

I see nothing wrong with this argument. It seems like a plausible scenario.

The reason illegal immigrants can't go to school is because there are no cheap private alternatives available to them.

Money laundering is not stealing from anyone. There is no theft involved. It's not transferring money to anyone either. It is taking their money and running it through shell companies and even paying tax on it to make it look like it is earned legally. 



Your argument (which I gave you) that it's bad because it supports criminal activity is inconsistent with your argument that we need to shift focus to white collar criminals. The crime of money laundering, in itself is completely victimless. 

Oh and by the way, no one is laundering for terrorist groups in Canada, and criminal organizations are doing their own laundering. That's why HA owns basically every strip club in the country. Cash business.

No - the cab driver used Muhammed as reference, as the Muslim did. Camels were relevant for Muhammed, thus it was also relevant for the Muslim. Race had nothing to do with this.

To expand on my process of thought. The Muslim didn't want to listen to music because Muhammed couldn't listen to music, because there were no music. Muhammed probably didn't drive a car either, and seeing as camels were often used for transportation in Arabia, one can assume it was also used by Muhammed.

So you can see the in-game world with the same clarity that you can examine real life?

> You don't need to see the whole world or have access to 5 senses in order to parse information and clues, the devs just have to design scenarios and the world in ways that encourage directed exploration. They even do that here to some extent, showing the bike at the beginning of the path the player is supposed to take, but apparently they don't trust their design skills or the player's intellect enough to let the hint stand on its own.

They did exactly what you're saying they should have done? They designed the world to suggest the direction, drawing the player to the bike. Then the player reveals more information through investigating the suggestion. Perhaps they could have designed heavy-handed footprints in the mud so the player can know that's the way to go, but after a certain point they're dedicating resources to make the game a detective game when it isn't. (Edit: And it's depending on the graphical limits of the system or of the player's setup. My TV isn't big/clear enough and dark visual clues often fail in my experience.) The character looked at the ground and saw visual cues, which is symbolically relayed to the player. 

> But the real point is that exploration is special when you get lost. Exploration in a world where you can't get lost is just pointless, imo. Exploration is about discovery and mystery, and if you can't get lost then there is none of that, everything is clear as day and may as well be linear.

That's just your opinion, and that has never been a consistent theme in open world games. I think getting lost in games when you don't have to be is a waste of time and that's exactly why developers get put in those hints. Not everyone wants to be lost in games. You've created this subjective and personal idealization of what open world games are and should be and decided that these features are an afront to those ideals, when open world have practically never consistently been what your ideal dictates. 

Open world are open on the sense that you can approach your objective from where you want. Does that mean you haven't to decipher where that objective is or explore in order to find it? No, it just means you're open to approach that objective how you want. It means there is a world for you to explore, it doesn't mean you have to be confused and lost within that world while trying to complete a mission. 

Open world games are games where the world is open. Full stop. Anything more is your own romanticization.

- employment is not at a record high. Best bet is the unemployment rate is the lowest it's been in 44 years. That's not ""all-time."" Citation:  http 

- employment doesn't mean a single goddamn thing if the job sucks. And all the jobs suck. The clearest gauge of this is real wages - the purchasing power of the dollars you're getting for the work - and that basically flat. As the economy grows the dollars don't reach real people. Citation:  http 

- while companies have never been richer, the poverty rate isn't changing. It's higher now than ~45 years ago. That's absurd. Citation:  http #/faq/what-current-poverty-rate-united-states

- you talk about ""entitlement,"" but let's look at the millennial generation. Americans aged 25-35, people who should have growing families and starter homes and solid careers, are averaging a salary of $35k a year. That's $20k less annually than their parents! Their average net worth is less than $11,000! Citation:  http 

- people take ""gig economy"" jobs out of desperation, forsaking real salary and benefits for the prospect of some money right now. But even the average gig economy pay dropped 50% from 2013-2017. People are screwed. Citation:  http 

- meanwhile corporations have never had more cash or lower taxes. And what do they do with that money? Make their own lives easier. None found its way to employees - as we showed earlier. Citation:  http

"> A political system built on the foundation of the Cultural Revolution leading to perhaps the largest body count of citizens by their own government in the history of humanity. 

The notion that China's modern political system was built upon the foundation of the Cultural Revolution is utterly absurd. The Cultural Revolution is one of very few of the egregious follies committed by the CCP for which the government is willing to express public and official contrition, and razed to the ground its official institutions. 

Just today in Sina there was an article about an ex-Red Guard apologizing to his teachers for his actions during the era. These articles have appeared with increasing regularity in recent months, perhaps partially due to efforts by the Xi-Li administration to distance themselves from Bo Xilai's Mao-revival movement. 

 http 

The current political system is based on the reforms and re-construction efforts inaugurated by Deng Xiaoping when he managed to inveigle his way to the position of paramount leader in China following Mao's death. 

It may fall short of our ideals of what a just and equitable political system should be, but it has proved remarkably resilient for the past three decades and incredibly effective at improving living standards and achieving economic growth. 

Virtues of the current political system that I would point to include its largely meritocratic character - akin in respect to the imperial civil service which characterized pre-modern China from the Tang Dynasty onwards, as well as term limits on holders of the top, preventing too much power from being amassed by individuals, or a gerontocracy from forming as it did in the Soviet Union during the seventies. 

> In other words, an economy and culture that can only imitate, but not innovate. How could this economy service the entire world?

China is a late developing economy - all of which needed to engage in imitation in order to reach parity in terms of capital assets and technology. 

All countries in the world with the exception of Britain engaged in industrial espionage, widespread imitation of overseas and the mass manufacture of cheap knock-offs in order to achieve development - including Germany and Japan. 

China is just following the same path, and once it reaches parity will begin innovating on its own. 

The country already has a remarkable track-record of pre-modern technological innovation - it was in most respects the most advanced society on the planet for most of the Common Era. It's also worth mentioning that disproportionate number of the West's top STEM researchers are currently either ethnic Chinese or PRC nationals. This bodes well for the mainland's ability to innovate in future. 

> An economy built on cheap disposable products for Americans and cheap counterfeit goods (that look like American-made products) for Chinese and Asian markets.

Have you spent much time in Guangdong province speaking to suppliers and outsourcers? I have. American traders tell me that the region scaled the value-added chain with frightening rapidity over the past decade, and in pretty much any product area imaginable can provide you with world-class quality goods (as long as you are willing to pay the premium for them.)

That's exactly what your post implies. Everyone on this thread interpreted it that way and even TKDers were telling you off for such a ludicrous position. Your argument seems to be if someone does 1% TKD training then TKD is necessary for MMA and they represent TKD and prove it's amazingness. MMA fighters train kickboxing for their striking 99% of the time. Even Pettis, even McGregor. They might throw a kick in here or there but they know where the knowledge is and that is in pro MT, boxing and kickboxing trainers and training. You think 1% of the training of 1% of MMA fighters should be talked up constantly, over and over. Dude, why don't you rep boxing or something, it is trained in MMA way more than TKD and always will be? The same for wrestling, kickboxing and BJJ. Even if suddenly every MMAer started going to the dojang, spinning hook kicks and slightly wider stances and elusive movement is still only 1% of MMA, and TKD does not have some sort of monopoly on those things anyway. And even accounting for all that it's only at the highest level that it would ever count for much. At our level, ie hobbyist, the fact that you do TKD is outweighed heavily by the fact that you have never done MMA, kickboxing, boxing, wrestling or BJJ.

"I live in the U.S., and have lived all over the country, and have an urge to try to find a way to live in Europe, with the U.K. topping the list but Sweden and Germany being a tie for second. Honestly the U.K. thing is mostly because if my mom weren't a Republican she could help me get U.K. citizenship through her. I don't really like the country that much, but it would be nice to do something different and I'm getting a little tired of the whole American thing at the moment because I have so little in common with everyone here. Most of my friends, and even my wife, are from other countries.

That being said, I think you have to understand that what you've seen on TV is not realistic. They are mostly painting a rose colored picture of what life is like for people who are either upper middle class or wealthy. Malcolm in the Middle is a little more realistic but even that isn't gritty enough. Maybe Breaking Bad is closer to reality in the U.S. Also watch American Beauty to get an idea of how the upper middle class live well but still suffer psychologically. Poverty, crime, and selfishness are rampant here. It's very isolating and there's no sense of community in most places.

If I do a work for hire for a company, say making a painting for them, and they paid me for that painting, and displayed the painting, I can't just rescind consent for them to display the painting and also keep the money.

The field exists to answer questions, not to force politicians to listen to the answers to those questions. Same applies to science. Philosophers are not public advocates and neither are scientists. 

Science did not put a man on the moon alone -- it required advocacy as well. It needed funding from governments. It needed people to be educated. None of that was done by science alone, it was done by advocates.

Let's say governments around the world start cutting funding for science and denying the existence of man-made climate change (oh, wait...) Would that be science's problem?

I'm not joking when I say it feels like I lost the best friend/brother I've ever had. 

Through therapy I also understand now that I locked my 'self love' deep inside of me and somehow the only way I could access it was via sex. Now that I lost sex I was going mental/furious thinking that that bitch took all 'love' I've had inside of me. Destroyed my most precious gift. 
Luckily I now know that that's not the case I just need to find new ways to access it. I'm currently looking for some voluntary work.

Firstly incel is the only one of those labels that is self harming, by identifying as an incel you are viewing yourself as less of a person, it¡¯s by definition an incredibly hateful way to view oneself. And once you start hating yourself then that leads to you hating others and the world around you.

Secondly, I don¡¯t believe you can just be an ¡®incel¡¯ part time. You may not be doing incel activities 24/7(like posting on incel message boards) but if you are identifying as an incel, even as part of your identity, you are essentially saying ¡®I am not good enough to be loved¡¯.

And when you¡¯re in that head space, then every action you take is dominated by that idea, which essentially leads to self sabotage.

You might not be sitting around all day chanting ¡®I hate myself¡¯, but that doesn¡¯t change the fact that it is there constantly, like an oppressive weight affecting everything in your life.

I know a lot about self hatred. Shit, I could have been classed as an incel long before the word was even invented. And I was an alcoholic to boot, which just increased all of that negativity by a factor of ten.

"> If you force mass immigration with the express intent of making the native population disappear over time due to interbreeding, that's an act of genocide.

You are playing fast and loose here with the term ""genocide"". Most people understand it to involve mass murder. Your argument rests on the scientifically baseless assumption that collectives can experience pain and death.

> I don't think it's moral, and the end result is the same: An ethnic group disappears from the face of the Earth, never to return. That is the definition of genocide.

Again, intermarriage isn't exactly what most people would call genocide. 

Moreover, you need to explain how collective identity is relevant to morality. Morality is about conscious suffering and well-being, and science provides no evidence that groups are conscious entities capable of experiencing suffering. 

You are confusing terms and concepts (e.g. force) that apply at the level of the individual with ones that apply at the collective level, and vice versa.

It'd make her unhappy in her marriage, cause even more tension between her and her husband, etc. So she deals with the hurt and the embarrassment and shame.

"29 yo, post-pubertal onset of 2ndary hypogonadism (low-normal LH/FSH levels but total T down in the 100-300 range before treatment)...

TLDR Version: Does hCG monotherapy often start working poorly? Why? What are my options?
I used Clomid 50mg/day before with great results but it stopped working when my IBS went from minor to severe. It's under control again, is it worth trying again?


Been around the block a few times. Tried Testosterone cypionate (T-cyp) for about a year and finally got to 200mg 1/week and felt slightly better. I learned the hard way that Endocrinologists are generally useless and clueless about hypogonadism. I've seen 2 university Urologists, and the first was more helpful than the second.
I used Clomid 50mg/day with awesome results for about a year. I have digestive disorders too and they went from mild to severe and the clomid stopped working. I suspect it was not being absorbed because of the digestive problems. My values were around 700-800 when I felt healthy. I was able to exercise 3/week (trail running for 40-75 minutes at 50-75% maxHR)

Since the clomid was so much better than the T-cyp, when it stopped working I got started on hCG. I was put on what I thought was a very conservative dose - 2,000IU 2/week. That didn't work well (T-test around 500 ng/dl and feeling fatigued 50% of days). We upped it to 2,000IU 3/week and I got up to about 750ng/dl and felt pretty good for a while.

Now I'm having symptoms again and I went in for a general checkup with bloodwork and found it's back at 525ng/dl. I asked to change the dose to alternating days to avoid having a bad day every week, and it came back at 499. 

I'd love to go back on the Clomid, but I have no idea if it would work. It ceasing to work did seem to correlate directly to my digestive problems, but the hard part is that my levels dropping is insidious and I'm not aware of it until they're really low. I'm using a new drug right now that is helping the digestive problems an amazing amount.

Obviously I need to talk to my Dr. What kind of things have others tried? I've seen a couple papers talking about hCG needing to be dosed up to 10,000 IU daily to maintain normal testosterone levels. I see a lot of parroted things from anabolic steroid users about how 500 IU is a high dose and Leydig cell desensitization, but nothing about it in any scientific papers. 
I don't have any particular issue with using massive amounts of hCG, I just want to know if it's going to be counterproductive in time. I'm sure there's a point where you get diminished returns, I just don't know where that point is or how much they are diminished.

I think it would really help to know why I'm having these issues in the first place, but everyone just seems to want to manage symptoms.

"I wasn't a frequenter of this sub in the ""macwithoutfries"" days so I have no opinion as to whether or not these might be the same people.

A few observations, though:

 It is clear there are a small number of people who routinely employ sock puppets on this sub, repeatedly engage in trollish behavior and, when banned, soon resurrect themselves under a different name. It is always one of two profiles: a) account created six or eight months ago (or even longer), zero comments, zero submissions, then all of a sudden and shortly after a known troll is banned, near hyper activity OR b) brand new account + recent troll banning + instant hyper activity. Either way, what has occurred is quite obvious.

 There are days when the up/down voting really only make sense when comparing comment tallies in context of the sub itself if there are a small number of people using multiple sock puppets in specific instances / in support of specific individuals

"Damn, I'm going to comment on this from the perspective of a guy who has kind of lived that life over the last half a century with the aim of hopefully passing on some of what I think I've learned. I do this to possibly help anyone else following along this convoluted path.

Being ""smart"" is really a double-edged sword, society seems to demand the world from you but since you're so smart they do very little to support you because they expect that you'll figure it out for yourself.

Now, add to that the issue that many of us figure out very early on that society is basically fucked in the way it rationalizes things and compound that by whatever twisted sense of ethics we are taught as well as decide for ourselves - and there's no wonder that many of our ilk have breakdowns.

If you are willing to accept the above, what we can and more importantly should accomplish is a widely varied palette, one that allows us a lot of flexibility.

This leads me to point out that identifying what it is that you want out of life is far more important than trying to answer what it is you are going to do with your life - because most of us (you) will do a lot of different things throughout the course of the next half century.

For me, applying myself to what I see as the ""big problems"" (you know the ones, the issues that everyone writes off as unsolvable) provides me with the comfort of believing I am making a difference. But making a difference in this manner means that the overwhelming majority can't or won't grasp what you're attempting to do nor will they rally behind it. 

Still, in cases where we are successful, we move humanity forward, as Norman Borlaug did. Conversely, if it is important to ""make a name for yourself"" many people have no idea who Borlaug was or what he did - so maybe you might want to devote your life to becoming a pop star, you know, like Justin Beiber.

What kinds of problems am I talking about?

How about constructing a societal system which allows for the best possible lifestyle for every single person, not just those who create wealth for themselves.

Okay - sounds easy, right?

What components of that goals prevent this from happening?

Some of the sticking points that I believe are holding us back from achieving this goal are: energy, housing, communications, transportation, food, a reliable/trustworthy system of justice, and the list goes on for as far and deep as anyone wishes to analyze the problem.

Pick one - and run with it.

"Hah, fair enough. Well I'm not sure what it is about how I'm speaking that makes it seem that way. I guess I have just adopted a certain style of speaking after being subjected to people over and over completely ignoring the role of diet in their health outside of ""calories in, calories out"".

Honestly I don't see the point in being a self-righteous twat. If I didn't want to help people then I wouldn't bother saying anything. I just am frustrated that so many of our problems today are caused by diet. Even for cases where the underlying cause isn't caused by diet (though things like coeliac's can be fully healed by adhering to a strict diet for around a year  http  ). I'm pretty sure my allergies count as an ""autoimmune disorder"" but whatever. I'm not trying to downplay anyone else's struggles with health, and I most definitely sympathise, but I actually don't think it's all that hard to ""understand"" either. I've had to adhere to a very strict diet and turn down pretty much any food anyone offers me for the last 5 years. I had months where I couldn't breathe properly at night and was worried I was going to die as I recalled my dad having similar problems when I was a teenager, and then he died when I was 17. Even my own family keep offering me the same things every time I go visit them, even after 7 years of figuring out the root cause of my poor health and depression (which has not recurred since improving my diet). My sisters have ended up improving their diet to lose weight, and they're starting to be more aware of the role of food in things like my nephew's mood, but I usually bite my tongue at doing anything other than give occasional anecdotes about things that have helped my health and mood (which is clearly, drastically different from when I was younger - even my boss at work noticed and asked me what had changed).

1) Why isn't the Zionist movement considered racist, or at the very least separationalist? The Jewish community has been ostracized and shunned from many places throughout history. To me it seems like it's no different than Muslim's enforcing Sharia Law, or Mormons enforcing strict values upon their communities... 

2) I notice a ton of people disagreeing on specific things in relation to the Torah, and more specifically a general separation within your own community. How does that affect Judaism? Christianity is broken down into thousands of sects, but it is different than Judaism because Judaism has fought tooth and nail to become one community.

3) For instance, Jews appear to form deep communities that are occasionally do not coincide with our modern melting pot. I believe we need to continue to mold our society as a whole, rather than separating it by religion or race. Jews were segregated and shunned from societies over and over, but is Judaism itself not separating within? For instance, how can a a traditional Orthodox Jew cry foul on history, and yet at the same time be anti-homosexual? Shouldn't we be promoting minority movements for fear that what happened to the Jews could happen to them?

""Now let me blatantly ignore all the other polished content in this game that isn't bad to make my nonexistent point."" I have. It's nothing special, but it's no where near the level of how bad the Zerk tree (or entire perk) was. Pretty much every skill in the Zerk tree was useless. I at least see some skills players could take advantage of in the Demo tree. None of the perk trees are super awesomely balanced, but I didn't expect that in the first place. They made it sound like for every tier, one skill was going to be for soloing, and one for teamwork. The major problem is that the teamwork ones are kinda lackluster. This is something they're clearly willing to fix based off player feedback.

>and yet they refuse to work with the community

I already addressed this. It's all early access, regardless of whether or not they release it one at a time or all together. People don't seem to realize if they have to release a small update each week, the build time is inevitably going to be longer. Having to spend every week hacking in some temporary fixes to game breaking bugs just to get a build out with a new weapon is not smart. Having to constantly tweak and change perk skills is just going to add more time. They're also working on improving the engine itself, so I don't see how they're going to be able to reasonably do this.

No, no, no. Completely false. Provably completely false. Have you heard of Standard Oil or Bell Telephone? Standard Oil alone enjoyed nearly two decades of monopoly before the Federal government had to invent anti-trust legislation for the purpose of shutting it down. Monopolies, once established, are extremely difficult to dislodge through market action. Doing so requires an entity with even bigger pockets than the monopoly, which is a) unlikely because the monopoly enjoyed monopoly profits for so long, and b) ultimately pointless because the it's in the interests of the new entity to use below price sales to drive the old monopoly under and become a new monopoly. 

So no, market failures do not categorically self-correct with time.

You argued ""a female rapist gives something that's unwanted so it's perceived (by men) as less criminal"". That is much different than assuming the sex should be wanted. In that instance, the woman's actions are not considered wrong because from that perspective she did nothing wrong; it is the male who failed to act properly. Likewise, your statement does not acknowledge that people do not think unwanted sex from a woman is actually harmful. You do appear to argue that only men view the act as less criminal, which is clearly inaccurate. We know at least some women -- those who commit rape, for example -- may consider the act less criminal.

I understand your points but you have to realize that your personal bias to this is keeping you from a proper structure. Like I said before, I like the setup and presentation, in fact everything about it - including production - is all very well done. The biggest problem is simply how the video struggles to convey information effectively. 

Here's a test for you: remove every bit of your comedy relief out of the video (including interactions between the two) and see what you have left. It should flow fairly well and the information should seem smoothly delivered. Think of the comedy as a parenthesis in a sentence. If it doesn't work when the comedy is removed then you have a problem. It's also a problem if your 9 something minute long video becomes only 3 minutes. 

I have a suggestion for your structure that I think would work pretty well. You have to break your video up into separate parts, similar to paragraphs. First you should introduce the subject at hand. Next you can bring in some light comedy. Then get into the meat of the information. If you have any back and forth here make sure it's either mot occurring when information is being rolled out or just keep it very short and contained. Actually, keep it short and contained anyways. Finally go into your closing. Feel free to go nuts here. Now do the test I talked about above and you'll see a dramatic improvement to quality because literally all that is left at that point is unbroken information. 

Go out and watch some other reviewers/reporters. For example, dirty bomb does something somewhat similar so check out how they do it. Maybe a 'quick look' format would better suite you with the back and forth comedy than a straight up info dump.

New Vegas does not have a final boss. Not sure what you're talking about. The different factions you pick largely want you to exterminate the others. Almost all of New Vegas is spent in combat, dialogue is minimal compared to combat. 

Strange that you'd bring up a game that proves my point. Fallout: New Vegas is not on any level, in any way shape or form, even remotely a game in the same vein as FO1 or 2. It is, however, exactly in the same vein as Fallout 3 and 4. 

Weird that you'd bring up the Powder Gangers, I'd say that's a failure of the game because it's something you see at the beginning of the game and then never again. Just completely abandoned. 

Fallout 4 is a radical improvement over New Vegas, anyway. New Vegas has poor gameplay balance, a boring world to explore, boring loot, a janky hardcore mode that doesn't even remotely make the game more challenging or immersive, etc.

"> For paying that 13.09$ extra, in this specific case, 10$(shipping) + 3.49(taxes/duties) + 3.50$(profit) = 16.99$ remained in the country and preserved/helped pay for at least 3 jobs, including the vendor.

When most people's first concern is finding or holding onto their own shit job, and making ends meet by any means necessary, they're not going to give a damn about this stuff, nor should they. You're in essence asking people to pay more to subsidize people who are already better off than they think they are.

All this pity for poor Canada Post is just obscene. They're a horrible company, with a long history of piss poor management, and yet they still manage to remain profitable due to their monopolistic and predatory nature.

Simply put, as a vendor you have one concern: doing better than the other guys in your neck of the woods. If you can't do that, someone else will. There are no pleas for sympathy for the poor Canadian business, appeals to patriotism or anything else. It's about the goods you carry and the price you sell them for, and how well you can convince people they need what you have, nothing more.

I'm certainly not saying that ""direct from China"" isn't a threat to your type of business - it absolutely is - but that isn't due to a failing of the consumer, that ultimately is due to your business model. There's always a bigger fish, and if you can't compete, you'll join the 90%+ of small business startups that fail. That is how it is.

Yes, because that is internet culture. Did you miss something in your first read of the book? Clearly, but it was you first read, and I don't think starting comics ""two months ago"" could in any way equate to you reading ""quite a lot."" Should you go to another Superman book and give him another shot? No, absolutely not. You should go back and read this again with more analytical eyes.

If you never thought Superman was in danger throughout the entire story, you missed a very crucial element of the book. He is, in fact, in ""danger"" throughout the entire thing - his death is on the table from the moment the book begins with his birth. What follows is the equivalent of the Hero's Journey or Hercules' Twelve Labors, in that Superman is given so many tasks to complete before he is unable to help humanity anymore, all of which are life-threatening labors (both his and others), as well as figuring out his appropriate legacy at the same time. It's the ultimate story of an alien being more human than your average person, and it's a perfect example of just why Superman and Lex Luthor make such dynamic foils. It's heartbreaking, it's beautiful, it's an ode to comics and the epitome of hope supreme, and it is one of the best comics I've ever read in my entire life -- one I re-read frequently and one I keep close to my heart as my comic book version of a bible.

"There are three parties to any public conversation- you, the other person, and the observer(s). There is also the greater context in which the conversation occurs, and the greater topics involved. 

For example: if I call out my racist uncle at Thanksgiving for being a trash person and a bigot, it's not just about him. He is not likely to be influenced anyway (because he's an arrogant shit who is set in his ways). The one who is likely to be influenced is the young cousin who sees confrontation of a racist, bigoted paradigm (promoted by the Uncle as ""True""). That is just as important, if not more important, because there are significantly longer-lasting effects. You're right, the bulk of it and the message is subconscious, but that doesn't actually matter because human communication is 90% nonverbal anyway.

Similarly, shooting a klansmen isn't just stopping that klansman; it's sending a message to other klansmen and to their victims.

I know that sounds like a sidetrack point, but it is a significant part of the issue in play: 

Declaring something as virtue signaling is to declare it a singular, self-centered, and hypocritical incident, and the one speaking as fundamentally selfish, when that is not often the case- standing up against injustice (in whatever form) is specifically an unselfish act. Sure those self-centered loudmouths exist and there are selfish loudmouths out there, but to paint something you disagree with as such is very manipulative and degrading; it is a cleverly crafted ad-hominem attack. These aren't televangelists pandering for donations from poor, gullible fools to buy their second jet.

On top of that, ""having conversations about a topic with a group of people who agree"" isn't simply ""in-group performance"" at all- that is literally how we learn and refine our opinions. Everyone does this. Painting it as self-centered is absolutely disingenuous and manipulative, and nothing but a bad faith argument.

No goalposts were moved. You claimed that vegan meals at restaurants are more expensive than non-vegan meals, and that is not true. When you actually compare apples to apples (i.e. vegan and non-vegan meals at the same restaurant), vegan meals are cheaper or the same price.

>And how do those restaurants stack up price wise with cheap fast food places? You know, the places the poorer parts of the country eat.

"Your argument is extremely flawed and it only seems to be popular because it's longer than the average post. In it, you came to the conclusion that everyone who supports the bill is racist.

You came to this conclusion because you argue the sole reason UKIP want to ban this practice is because Pakistani people disproportionately engage in it. So if you're arguing that, you have to prove that UKIP only want to ban this because of the cultural group that do it.

And in your argument for this you've provided very sketchy reasoning and no evidence for that claim, which should be pointed out.

>You might initially imagine the reason for this bill was something to do with genetic disorder prevalence associated with first cousin marriage

This is the, in your eyes, ""non-racist"" argument for banning first cousin marriage. It's the argument that /u/GeoSmith16 and others are arguing in this debate, and it's the argument which people naturally assume is the rationale behind this legislation.

>it turns out that first cousin births give a similar defect rate (roughly 2% higher than the general population) to a woman giving birth at the age of 41. So, biologically speaking, there's nothing really wrong with first cousin birth

I see two lines of reasoning you've gone down by saying this, the first one deals with trying to expose UKIP for the racist party they are, and the second is to argue that first cousin marriage is biologically fine. Both of these intertwined arguments you make are totally flawed in many ways.

1. GeoSmith16 believes that first cousin marriage is not biologically okay. You believe it is. Your reasoning for GeoSmith and UKIP being racist here is that the only reason they oppose first cousin marriage is due to cultural connotations. What you've had to do is take your own opinion that first cousin marriage is biologically okay and apply it to everyone who disagrees.

In other words, you think your belief that first cousin marriage is biologically acceptable is so right that everyone who disagrees with you must know this. It's not even up for debate, you think, it is settled. It is reasonable that you believe first cousin marriage is biologically sound, but in order to argue that UKIP are being RACIST here you have to assume they secretly agree with you on that and are using the biological case as a facade in order to ban something to satisfy their concealed cultural prejudice.

And this is very stupid. You really should have saved your ""THAT'S RACIST"" ammunition, which you're scared to use because we always hold you to account for it, for another battle in the name of social justice against conservative opinion.

Just because you think first cousin marriage is biologically acceptable (for flawed reasons which I will move onto after this) does not mean GeoSmith, and UKIP, also think it. Isn't it ""projecting"" to think that an opinion you hold strongly must also be held by other people deep down? Your argument that UKIP are being racist relies on this, because if they are arguing for this bill on purely biological grounds (which they so far are, in what they have said in this debate) then they aren't arguing for it on cultural grounds.

This reasoning also relies on another fallacy, that there are only two possible cases for banning first cousin marriage: the biological case and the RACIST case. Although UKIP are so far arguing the former, you've concluded they can't be because it's wrong and therefore must really be doing this because they're racists.

2. First cousin marriage is biologically sound because first cousin births ""give a similar defect rate to a woman giving birth at the age of 41.""

I'm afraid this reasoning is also flawed. Now before I start, I don't know anything about this subject and nor do I particularly care, I just think the desperation you exhibit to brand UKIP racist is so intense that it leaves behind a trail of fallacious, laughable reasoning which someone has to clean up. That someone has to be myself today because poor old GeoSmith is so preoccupied arguing a case he doesn't really believe in, due to the fact he's secretly racist and wants to gas inbred Pakistani babies, that he can't defend himself against this complete drivel.

>it turns out that first cousin births give a similar defect rate (roughly 2% higher than the general population) to a woman giving birth at the age of 41. So, biologically speaking, there's nothing really wrong with first cousin birth

This is a whataboutism at best. But that's not the only crisis going on in this argument.

So in that argument you already admit first cousin births give a defect rate of 2% higher than the general population. But then you add ""But so do women above the age of 41, so that's fine."" ",1

You can fill your tummy and get your daily calories and energy for much cheaper with a big bag of frozen chicken than you can with the alternative. I can go to the shops now and get about 4kg of chicken breasts for about ¡ê10. Alternative products like soya are much more expensive, even own-brand options. Vegetables and fruits are equally expensive. Cheeses, milks and oils are expensive and in the cases of cheeses and milks are similarly problematic. Carbs in the way of bread, potatos and pasta can be got cheap but I'm not sure with the obesity issue we should be encouraging people to cut down on meat and overindulge on those. Eating ethically, if you can do such a thing in a capitalist society, does hit the pocket. Most of the cheap alternatives to meat that you can name are probably not farmed ethically anyway so I have reservations about how big an impact a diet change would even be.

But, I'm perfectly happy to entertain something else if it makes sense. Lay it on me.

No, it lends credibility to the possibility that the mural was once supposed to refer to a bigger deal than the UFOs, and they left it in the game to refer to just the UFOs. Which leaves us with ""the mural is just about the UFOs"".

>>The mural has 5 Xs that lead to the glyphs, and a big red eye on top of the mural that is in the position the Chiliad UFO shows up in, right above the platform that has the same eye underneath it. It's clearly related to the UFO sighting and telling you how to witness it.
>
>I agree, but that doesn't explain the other symbols at the bottom

They are hints to the locations of the other UFOs. The UFO is seen on top of the car at the hippie camp, the egg is seen at Paleto Bay, and the jetpack is supposed to lead GTA:SA players to this game's version of Area 69. At each one of those, there is a secondary UFO close by.

>Well a similar conclusion for both of them would be that they were only meant as set pieces, and not as cryptic easter eggs.

I agree that would be possible, except, as I said, the mural leads to a tangible result. The hamburger sign doesn't (yet).

>I personally don't think either of these are solved, I just don't see how you can decide on a ""logical"" conclusion for one and not the other.

Because the mural clearly points to a UFO hovering above the mountain, and there is a giant UFO in the game hovering above the mountain, right next to the mural. That's a pretty big Exhibit A.

>Since many people have tried to decode the Famous Hamburger sign, the ""logical"" conclusion is that it means nothing.

Agreed, it might mean nothing. But, it definitely looks like a code so I think it's reasonable to think it means something (even if the ""something"" is dumb, like an inside joke from a dev telling his friend Jeff Figo to go fuck himself).

"It may seem odd, and I can understand how it may look to someone who isn't really into props/costuming. My first career was as a make-up FX/prop artist for TV and Film, and I have probably worked on many of the movies and TV you've seen. So, for someone like me, these ""odd"" details are very important. 

I never said I was against going to a metalworking shop to have it welded. I am just trying to create a pattern that best represents the original, and then leaving it in the hands of those fans that attempt to create it to use whatever they have at their disposal. 

I will personally not use JB weld on this project, and have contacted a local metal worker about doing the welds for me. 

But that is really beside the point. I may be overstating the importance of bend deduction and such, but that is because I am trying to learn for the sake of knowing, and because I want to know if it will have any effect on my final design.

Sure, I could just wing it, and cut out five different pieces of metal and figure out what works, but I kind of figured I would first consult experts in metal work, in the hopes that they would be able to use their experience to save me hours of trial and error, and wasted materials. 

As for how I can take measurements that accurate. There are tricks that prop designers use to reference different parts of the costume. Then using reference, math, and experience, and often times various sources/angles/references, come up with is often quite accurate. 

For example, there was a prop from Indiana Jones that had been recreated over a span of 20 years or so by keen-eyed fans, using nothing but screen grabs, and reference photos. Years later someone was given unrestricted access to the original, and it turned out the fans were as close to 100% accurate as anyone could be. 

All that said...

If making test pieces is what needs to be done, then that is what need to be done. It is what I would have most likely done back when I was working in the FX shop. I suppose I was just hoping that a lot of time and materials could be saved by first looking at this from a theoretical perspective, then applying it. 

Like, if someone came to me and said, ""I am attempting to sculpt a zombie mask to re-create this character in The Walking Dead TV show, and I don't know which is the best tool for making wrinkles.""

I have a lot of experience in that, so instead of saying, ""You're just going to have to experiment, because..."" I can actually say, ""You're going to need to first try using a number 2, loop tool, and then lay down plastic wrap, and go over it with the end of a chopstick, or wooden tool.""

That experience would save them a lot of hours of frustration and wasted time.

His comments about how military leaders can't assume the army is invincible were read as a tacit admission that reform had to be pushed through. His criticisms of leaders revering the civil war and its traditions of spirit and elan, and the Red Army's delusions about the victory in Poland being a real war. He also emphasized that tanks would be needed in the thousands rather than hundreds, and en masse rather than scattered. Finally, Stalin criticized the lack of initiative by the leaders of the Winter War, which was basically Stalin eating crow because he appointed those leaders, he bypassed the General Staff and he micromanaged the war.

Your original statement was:
>The embarrassment of the Winter War against Finland in 1939-1940 forced Stalin's hand and combined arms, massed armor, and the doctrine of mobile attack were no longer taboo.

Unless that statement was a simple generalization, I don't see it coinciding with what you said further above. And, once more, while the Winter War changed much in terms of Soviet military doctrine, it had little if anything to do with armor doctrine nor did it overturn any 'taboos'.

But considering your passive aggressive ""do us all a favor"" attitude it looks like I need to preface my comment that I'm very Machiavellian. That is straight, honest and too the point without regards to your feelings.

Now with that out of the way. Let's look at the points of information that your wife presented. 

1) She's been presented with a contract
2) She's unsure of said contract.

Now. You're saying that I should've asked for more information. In this instance, there is no more information required for my comment. It doesn't matter if the sub is new or experienced. It's a HUGE red flag. If a sub is presented a contract that they do not agree with. They need to throw that contract away! That's it. It's that simple. There is no arguing here. There is no room for error. Getting consent through a contract is not how this world works. And I'm going to let you know, that if you ever run into a sub on here or in real life tell you that she is presented with a contract that she doesn't agree with. The first words out of your mouth are: ""Don't sign it!"".

Now for the 50 shades a Grey part of my comment. That was not an implication of you two being posers or noobs. In the book Grey tries to get his girl to consent by signing a contract. Now with the two points that your wife presented outlined above, you can see how these two situations sound similar. Hence the 50 shades of Grey part of the comment. Arguably, I could've explained this part better.

With that said, you can hopefully understand why my comment is absolutely appropriate for what your wife presented. Now about your ""please don't post in here"" comment I can safely say go fuck yourself. I said the right thing for the information presented. It might have hurt your or your wife's feelings. But it will only be temporary. You'll both get over it.

Now let's get back to the issue at hand. Your wife used the word contract, you say it's not a contract but even your description sounds something like a contract. Especially if your wife/sub decides that she wants to follow it to closely to be a good sub.

So what is this document? How does it differ from a contract?

You mentioned that it outlines expectations, goals, and protocols. That sounds similar to a contract.

What is the purpose of this document?

You say your wife is new. What experience does she have?

Why do you need to have your expectations/protocols written down? If she's new as you say, don't you think this is too early? If she's new, shouldn't she be allowed to experience this world first and then once she has some base of understanding. Then she can start talking about protocols and expectations? How can she even discuss these things if she's new?

Why do you think this type of document is good for her?

Most importantly, why would your wife feel like these documents would destroy her identity?

What' ""saw as"" meant to mean? sounds like when people say ""I see marriage a between a man and a woman and nothing else"". It's a not very honest way to frame ""people not like me make me feel uncomfortable for reasons I can't articulate"". ""see"" implies some innate natural reaction, but all this stuff is learned behavior that can be changed.

Humans do have a natural tendency to be jealous/insecure, but we also have a natural tendency to get angry, possessive, selfish as ell. They're all vices we should seek to remove from our character. Only with jealousy and insecurity do people seem okay with enshrining them as innate preferences rather than flaws.

The fact is you can learn not to be jealous and insecure about things like a girl having slept with someone you know. Not only can you do it but its much better for you if you learn to deal with those emotions rather than just hide from them, because those emotions pretty much universally stem from a lack of confidence and comfort with yourself and your value.

"Let¡äs set aside any differences and pretend our entire community speaks with one voice. Let¡äs also pretend our demand has even the slightest chance to be heard in a world that gets increasingly mad and vicious , with global crises, nationalism and despotism on the rise (Erdogan, Putin and Tangerine Nightmare, for example).

To bring change, we need a political party. Which existing party would openly support our claims? None. Would we found our own, monothematic party, with all that¡äs needed like money (lots of it), a program and foremost, faces people can and will remember the next time they stand in the election booth? Who would commit social suicide? Who would definitely ruin his or her life extensively and will be known as ""the animal fucker"" advocate ¡ätil the end of his life? 
A monothematic party usually doesn¡ät last very long in parliaments, the Pirate party being one of the examples for that . Strong in Germany and other European countries a few years ago, but only for one election. When we talk about change, we have to respect the DEMOCRATIC process. Like it or not, it is a fact that laws against ""zoophilia"" are what the people want. I doubt there will ever be a majority that marches the streets around your parliament, waving signs with slogans like "" animal sex is human right"" or something similar. Most people are GLAD these laws have been introduced. To turn around a majority of people 180 degrees from what they¡äre thinking is wishful thinking, at best. Especially when the group of people trying to influence public opinion does everything to alienate Average Joe and Jill with irresponsible actions that harm society in whole (fencehopping, animal porn distribution etc...). The ""normal"" , democratic process to change laws will not succeed when you don¡ät have the ""political climate"" to support your claims. The ""summer of Love"" of the 70¡äs was a political singularity, a once-in-a-milennium incident, fueled by the Vietnam war and , more importantly, the then independent media coverage of it, showing absurdity, cruelty and suffering instead of a glorious fight of ""our ""heroes. Compare it to today¡äs ""embedded journalism"" and you see what this was and will probably be a singularity for the next 500 years to come. 

The people are against us. What other ways do we have? We can hope for science to come up with my ""UAHT"" , the universal animal-human translator. To convince the majority, this is nothing less than obligatory and the only way accusations of rape will disappear once and for all. Only when an animal can communicate its wishes and desires clearly, saying ""I want to have intercourse with my human"", only then a majority of people will change their minds and make change possible.
What else is there for us? Let¡äs see...lobbyism, clandestine lobbyism like what the multinational corporations do. We simply don¡ät have enough wealth and influence for that. 
Some of us might even think about becoming dictators, taking over their country, issuing decrees that wipe away any of these ""unjust"" laws. But dictatorship is Janus-headed, unhinged power quickly brings out the worst in everyone. It¡äs not just a coincidence that there hasn¡ät ever been a ""dictatorship of clemency"" yet, power corrupts...do you want to live under a dictator who ""allows"" fucking animals, but shits on basic human rights? Are you willing to pay this price?

What else is left? Challenging the laws via lawyers may look like a promising way to get things done, but this is also nothing but an utopian fever dream. Our worldwide community of beasties and zoos has made the mistake of putting the most unfavorable picture of us out there, establishing the image of zoophilia = animal abuse for centuries. There¡äs a reason zoophilia is a synonym for fucking animals now. Voices like mine aren¡ät heard, more porn with clear signs of abuse is uploaded every day, our public image completely shattered. Where are the pictures showing the love instead of the sex? Haven¡ät seen many, to be honest. To influence the public image, you have to play the game according to THEIR rules. You have to respect the fact that poly crap, mixed ""zoophilia"" (animals and humans), ""fuck parties"" and ""making it possible for a ""zoo friend"" to scratch one entry from his/her ""bucket list"" undeniably send out the message "" They call it zoophilia, love for animals, but it¡äs neither , it¡äs not about animals, it¡äs about human selfish desires, and it¡äs not about loive , it¡äs about sex and the itching in the groin"". 

So, is there anything else left? Not to my knowledge. Public opinion changing? Forget it, not with what our community presents itself in the internet. Science? Hell, when the best we have is often cited, but rarely understood Hani Miletski ""study"", science is kind of a dead end right now. Legal actions? See ZETA and their attempt to challenge the German law. And the BVerfG was VERY kind, even made it clear that the law has a loophole in it that allows judges to acquit ""zoophiles"" when punishment creates more harm than it prevents.

I appreciate your desire to ""legalise"" my orientation, but I also see that we¡äre not living in the times for that right now. 
As hard as it is to swallow for you, but we have to learn to live with the laws, have to learn how to minimise the damage they CAN do to some of us. We have to prioritize PRIVACY...common sense is self defense. We have to be patient and wait for another of these moments like the ""summer of love""...wait for another of that tremenduously rare moments when everything seems possible. Timing is vital. Our enemies outnumber AND outgun us by 1 to a million, maybe even more...we have to instrumentalise guerrilla tactics, hit and run...and we have to wait for that one moment in time and space...this moment when one good punch thrown at the right spot topples Goliath. Unloading all our ammo into a concrete wall that¡äs 5 kilometers thick is stupid...
Patience is needed as much as awareness of our real situation , without any of this ""zoo is the new gay"" sermon, without furor. Snipers, Ninjas and Saboteurs, that¡äs how we should deal with the current situation. 

And while we sit and patiently wait for OUR chance, for the next singularity opening up to place this one, gamechanging shot, you, Egoldstein, should be thankful for your Finnish prime minister and his sturdyness against Op Beast¡äs blackmail attempts. Be grateful that you¡äre one of the ""lucky"" three countries in Europe that hasn¡ät introduced ""anti zoo"" laws (yet). You should hope that incidents like the one with the intoxicated ""pig lover"" from the article stay rare, hope that the lack of ""anti zoo"" laws won¡ät turn your country into a safe haven for animal fuckers and pornographers from around the world, undermining the trust your government places in the rationality of Finnish zoophiles (although....I¡äve met two Finns during my IRC times...they can easily count as top ten material of the most fucked up people I¡äve ever met).

Are you not aware that hackers and modders cannot join private sessions, and thus can't mess with you there? Are you even aware private sessions exist? Do you play with a crew? Are you aware you can do that, and it actually makes the gameplay experience better? Have you experimented with free aim sessions, which aren't as populated, and don't attract as many cheaters?

As I said before, there are ways around these assholes. It sucks you have to do it, but if the game is worth playing, it's worth spending a little extra time isolating yourself from the kinds of players you don't like. I don't do player combat and I don't like griefers; I discovered free-aim players are more civilized in this regard, so I switched aim preference, and the problem is solved.

In the Catholic church, we are expected to become servants of the church. That part is fine, I believe that we can and should serve the church, but Catholicicsm takes it to another level, where we are to be subservient to the church and to do its bidding. At a local level this is usually not a problem, the priests and the bishops have the best interest in heart usually and concern themselves with pastoral care; the problem stems from abroad. Cardinals and the Pope (who I have much, much respect for) each time determine more and more teachings which are to be accepted without question. Funnily enough, the topic of papal infallibility, which I am told at certain times ALWAYS applies, and when questioning it that is SOMETIMES applies, wasn't even something until 1869, in which it was declared under infallibility that the Vatican was now infallible. Whenever someone in the church is confused about a topic, or the have a question, both the priest and the members are pretty helpless.

"The vast majority of those 300 million+ guns will be broken, rusted out or otherwise unusable within 10 years, and you can accelerate their removal with generous tax credit and buyback programs for turning them in. And the same thing is true of high capacity magazines. Eventually, they'll break and have to be replaced, and if the only legal thing to replace them with is a low capacity magazine, well, that's what law-abiding gun owners will use, and we'll reach a point where even criminals will have a hard time getting ahold of fast-reload weapons with high capacity magazines because there won't be very many of them left around anymore. You don't see many holdups with Colt Peacemakers anymore, after all. A policy of restricting reload times to 10 seconds or greater and banning the manufacture of high capacity magazines isn't one to create a difference tomorrow, or next year, but it will have a difference 5, 10 and 20 years down the line.

Your mistakes with thinking that more concealed carriers will be a solution are (at least) two-fold. First, correlation doesn't equal causation. Even if I bought your assertion that concealed carriers were less likely to commit crimes than police officers, the reason for that is because the process of getting certified to conceal and carry already weeds out those inclined to commit crimes. It doesn't change the people, it self-selects. Pushing more people through the process is just going to make it more likely that concealed carriers commit crimes. Second, putting more bullets into a shooting situation just increases the chances that innocent bystanders get hurt. The goal is to get an active shooter to stop shooting, not get everybody else to start.

The situation in France was a failing of local security forces during a celebration. More concealed carriers there would have been unlikely to stop that tragedy, and would have a much greater chance of making it worse by having more innocent people get caught in the crossfire. That said, lone-wolf terrorists and crazy people won't ever be stopped from trying to kill a bunch of people, and sometimes they'll succeed. The goal should be to make it as hard as possible for them to succeed keeping in mind that perfection is never going to be attainable, while minimizing the risks to everybody else. Concealed carriers don't minimize those risks, they exacerbate them.

The reason gun control discussions aren't fruitful is because recreational gun collectors/users value their own access to their preferred form of entertainment and dubious security over the lives of other people's children and grandchildren, and will appeal to the most spurious rhetorical fallacies to support their preferences. From an appeal to futility (there's too many guns with those features to get rid of them all! Yes there are a lot of them, but we'll never get fewer of them if we don't do something to stop their proliferation), to the perfectionist fallacy (killers will still be able to kill people! Yes, they will, but it'll be a lot harder for them to do that and the incidence of occurrence and deadliness of those incidents will be reduced), to the legalist fallacy (It's my constitutional right to be armed, so it's not wrong for me to want a 100 round magazine for a semi-automatic weapon capable of being reloaded in half a second that can fire three rounds per second.

It doesn't surprise me at all that you haven't experienced this kind of harassment for yourself, then.

"I have to take issue with your argument about ""no genetic basis for inherited immunity"". 

First, I am an actual PhD in microbiology (you can look at my admittedly brief history of posting to see a post I made a month ago talking about the class I'm teaching.)

Secondly, this article in PNAS discusses an inherited mutation that confers a survival advantage in people who's ancestors survived multiple rounds of small pox.

>The high frequency, recent origin, and geographic distribution of the CCR5-¦¤32 deletion allele together indicate that it has been intensely selected in Europe. Although the allele confers resistance against HIV-1, HIV has not existed in the human population long enough to account for this selective pressure. The prevailing hypothesis is that the selective rise of CCR5-¦¤32 to its current frequency can be attributed to bubonic plague. By using a population genetic framework that takes into account the temporal pattern and age-dependent nature of specific diseases, we find that smallpox is more consistent with this historical role.

Translation: smallpox mortality selected for a variant gene (called CCR5-¦¤32) that confers a higher rate of survival in individuals exposed to a virus that uses that portal of entry - as does smallpox (and HIV). That CCR5-d32 allele is found only in populations in Europe.

"When I say the majesty of the universe I don't mean some pie in the sky idea where I just think the world is swell ergo god. I have tried to reason this out and consider the incredible complexity of existence, the fact that there are hundreds of millions of galaxies and hundreds of millions of stars in each one, the sheer scale of everything, from the farthest reaches of the universe to the smallest atomic particles, and most important of all the very fabric of existence, physical and mathematical properties. What reason is there for things to exist? Wouldn't it be just as easy for there to be nothing at all? But somehow all of these principles came into being and led to the development of sentience. I like to think of the quote ""you are the universe experiencing itself."" Those types of ideas make it hard for me to believe that everything just suddenly was. There seems to be too much purpose and order to it all. I'm not trying to argue for intelligent design in the classical sense. Rather, I am saying it seems unlikely to me that a universe with physical properties such as our own could exist without something that brought it into being. I have no idea what the nature of that something is, but I know it has to be there. 

As I stated I consider myself a panentheist such that there isn't the distinction between God and the physical universe we like to imagine. I don't really believe in an anthropomorphized God, I think it is so much further beyond the realm of our understanding than that, and interpenetrates every part of the universe and extends beyond it. That seems most likely to me, and in a more subjective romantic sense I feel an emotional connection.

>Also how disconnected are you from the Palestinian resistance movement that you think the peak of its action is petitions and demonstrations? You know theres actual armed struggle going on, right?

I know all this, and my point is anarchists can participate in it without reference to the question of statehood. What action does specifically reference statehood? Only the ""politics of demand"", which can be coupled with armed struggle but isn't necessary for it, and is very alien to how anarchists practice direct action.

This requires a degree of keeping capitalism underdeveloped, retaining pre-capitalist social formations like feudalism in the countryside.

And yes, why define marriage as being between the two sexes? Answer that for me.

Why does it matter how marriage is defined? What exactly happens when we redefine it? Will couples stop reproducing?

> I said it's not feasible. It would be costly (on a national scale) and intrusive to test for fertility anytime somebody wanted to get married. You would have people disputing the results as well because people who are determined to be fertile sometimes end up producing children.

Oh, so it isn't very important then to prevent infertile people from marrying. So why is it important to prevent gay people from marrying?

> Yeah I don't think you understand what I said. The whole point is that gay marriage is in the spotlight. People are considering it, and when considering it, you have to... you know... actually considerate it. If infertile marriages were currently in the public spotlight, people could make the case that their lack of fertility is a mark against them receiving benefits, and they would have a point.

I guess. I mean, I'd say that he mentioned things that at least seemed possible although I'm not sure if specifics that he gave seemed practical or likely to work.

War God: ""Yahweh, prior to becoming Yahweh, the national god of Israel, and taking on monotheistic attributes in the 6th century BCE, was a part of the Canaanite pantheon in the period before the Babylonian captivity. Archeological evidence reveals that during this time period the Israelites were a group of Canaanite people. Yahweh was seen as a war god, and equated with El. Asherah, who was often seen as El's consort, has been described as a consort of Yahweh in numerous inscriptions.[1] The name Yahwi may possibly be found in some male Amorite names.[2] Yahu may be found in a place name.""

Because most PTSD does not develop from war. That claim is simply false. There's nothing more to it than that. I'm going to go ahead and make an assumption here, so forgive me if I am off base. Most anti-social justice types incessantly mock PTSD triggers. To co opt the concept so it can be turned around on some shitty thing an SRSer said is really crappy. It's just a crappy thing to do. Does that particular person normally mock PTSD triggers? I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong. I hope I am; but I think it's a fair assumption in this case. If a community almost ubiquitously denies the legitimacy of PTSD triggers, it's really really shitty to co opt the struggles of PTSD stricken soldiers to stick it to some douches on an internet forum.

Let me make a guess... you don't read Christian books or websites, instead you spend your time reading Dawkins, Hitchens, listening to things like ""The Scathing Atheist"" and spend time watching Penn Gilette and Dawkins on youtube. In short, you are living in an atheist echo-chamber. No wonder you are so abrasive and aggressive with your views.

You mention Popper et. al. yet they are a very recent addition, coinciding with a general drop in the teaching of philosophy, making views like his (that have been around since the Greeks) float to the surface. Popper even said himself that he had no time for metaphysics... well no wonder he doesn't understand religion. That would be like asking someone who has never studied Physics to understand the Standard Model. It would sound crazy to them. Now imagine how String Theory or Quantum Chromodynamics sounds to someone without the prerequisite years study.

And before you pull out the tired trope ""well philosophy is nonsense"", reflect on the fact that mathematics is a subset of philosophy. Philosophical proofs have the same logical force as mathematical ones... and a rigorous study of metaphysics has the existence of God pop out surprisingly naturally. As long as the prerequisite study to understand the arguments has taken place first.

Yes many religious people are only following what their parents told them to do... but does that make religion itself unsound? There are equally many people who like and trust Physics, yet would have no clue how to prove the Biot-Savart law.

No, you're just not very good at detail, especially when you're ranting. Your assertion which I confronted was specifically about ""parroting the brainless Shareblue/establishment narrative"".

What u/Uhillbilly does is neither brainless nor parroting: he selectively picks small nuggets from what you claim, perhaps correctly, is a ShareBlue-compromised site to use to denigrate Trump and associated minions and/or Republicans in entirely appropriate ways which do not support (other than by being to a reasonable degree true) the enveloping ShareBlue narrative's propaganda.

I don't waste my time paying close attention to ShareBlue's crap, but my impression is that its 'narrative' includes considerably more than merely beating on Trump and his flying monkeys - e.g., RUSSIA!!! (with all its accompanying detail like its having cost Hillary the election as 'proved' by all 13 of our infallible intelligence agencies - or at least a dozen members hand-picked from 3 of them in the best Cheney tradition - even more solidly than than Trump's treason which only has the support of mostly retired members of those agencies who can afford to shoot off their mouths without much fear of consequences but of course that's surely sufficient, its 'invasion' of Ukraine, the careful avoidance of inconvenient facts such as our contribution to its 2014 coup using neo-Nazis, drastic NATO eastward expansion after the agreement that this would not occur...) and I suspect more than passing mention of how fanciful progressive proposals are, pleasant as they may sound.

ShareBlue has its filthy fingers in a whole lot of pies, but the only pie u/Uhillbilly is interested in is the Trump pie and as noted he nibbles fairly selectively even on that one.

"Oh man, thanks for your response, much better than the other guy. Still wrong though. 

First up, You seem to be making claims about my character and life based on a simple comment. I feel great on a day to day basis, life is good!

2nd, it does make sense. My argument was that as i understand it, the person i would debate on shooting (The westboro baptist) would cause nothing but pain and misery to others in their life. 

3rd, i was referring to a chance they may leave the westboro baptists for another life.

4th, I argue that killing a random person is not intrinsically a bad thing. Innocent or no. I have come to the conclusion that self interest is all that matters, if I could live a vastly better life by doing this and live happily with myself, why wouldn't I? 

5th, I say sure as a filler.

6th, Well Today I learnt. Equally, there is no blame to place, so it is all misguided. I'll let you worry about ""good reason"". That seems subjective, your bar is set much higher than mine it seems. 

7th, Nice ad hominem, real mature buddy. Also, I'm not arguing from a point of morality, purely self interest. It would seem that shooting someone who I deem to be a terrible person for the good of myself is great. its not that i ""lack the courage"", its that it'd negatively impact me, through guilt. Shooting someone that would not yield the same guilt, is a different case.

8th, Wrong. Killing an innocent person to save the entire human race is a moral action. Moral absolutes are retarded.

9th, How is it that you have decided i would NOT kill Hitler? Because i can assure you if i could go back in time, be given a gun in a room alone with Hitler, i would without a doubt shoot him. Simple stuff. 

10th, great quote, i like it. I was talking about moral absolutes being the white and black. Nothing is intrinsically right or wrong, its all relative to the situation.

11th, Shame we aren't friends buddy, I'm a nice guy. What else could good and bad mean? Well I don't know man. Anything. It's all relative. Im sure the radical islamists thought blowing up the twin towers was a great act of morality. And others don't. So who is right? There is no one conception of good and bad. Why do I have to accept your form of morality? Why would i care for the well being of other creatures? Hell I care about myself, my friends and my family. This doesn't mean I don't care for the layman. I just care less. Animals too, surely we are willfully causing harm to those conscious creatures? But we do it anyways, because out self interest overrides that of the animals. Same applies here. My self interest overrides that of the person i choose to shoot.

What stops the world degenerating into a murderspree? Well its not in peoples self interest to cause anarchy, is it? Why would they? they have no reason to. 

You're right about ""dont kill innocent people"", its a good law, but is it a moral absolute? No. 

12th, You're right! I don't have targets, but i'm speaking in hypothetics, do try to keep up. Weak and impotent degenerate? Kind words, and nice Ad Hominem, last time i checked that was SUPER relevant. 

13th, Suppose I am prejudice in this case, it doesn't mean im wrong however. Prejudices can often be correct.

I have very good reason to make the assumption. Namely, almost no one disagrees that there are objects which exist objectively. Subjective idealism is an extreme minority position in philosophy and certainly not a common sense view. But even if the comment was in favor of subjective idealism, that would still make subjectively existing objects a subset of existing objects, just no longer a proper subset. Thus, I maintain my position that I have in no way ""given a counterexample for a subset of his claim without saying anything about the rest"". I gave examples of objects which are thought about, but have no existence regardless of qualifiers attached and subjective existence is a subset of existence.

And another one for you, even if someone is armed you need to fire 3 warning shots before you can fire on them unless you are 100% sure if you do not fire on them they will kill a royal.

The top linked youtube result is """"STOP RESISTING!!"" Cops going crazy"" vs a white dude, the top Google images are an incapacitated white man with a gun pointed at him, a cartoon of Lady Justice being beaten by a cop, a bunch of protestors of mixed races being detained by cops, an image of a cop beating a black man with the text ""The decline of civilization will be carried out by those who are just doing their jobs,"" a (fake) image of a cop beating a white child, an image of a cop pepper-spraying a white woman, a cartoon of two cops deciding whether to shoot a puppy or beat it with nightsticks first, etc. Absolutely zero pro-authoritarian imagery. Don't take my word for it, google it for yourself.

Again, not trying to diminish the impact of whatever you've come into contact with, but I think your experience has been very polarized.

You actually have the story/parable reversed.

So it was the king who forced him into that position. Sun Tzu specifically appointed the king's favorite concubines as the commanders, and they were the ones who were executed. This was done over the king's protests, as Sun Tzu indicated that a king's orders (you know, the whole ""turn my whores into warriors"") were paramount, and thus illustrates another, oft-overlooked point: that a king should not carelessly throw away the lives of those under his command.

Incidentally, this story was recorded by ""historian"" Sima Qian, who was born about three centuries after Sun Tzu died. I'm pretty sure you can figure out how I feel about the veracity of this story. Either that, or you believe every word of what Marco Polo said about China.

$1000/month for food? There are (presumably) 3 of you, and one of you is a small child (because otherwise the $2000/month you pay for childcare would be a complete waste). When my family had foreign exchange students living in the house there were a total of 6 of us, all pretty much fully grown. My parents paid $600/month on food for the 6 of us, and it's not like we didn't eat well. We went out to eat usually once every other week and everything.

$4000/vacation. WASTE OF MONEY. My sister and her husband went to san fransisco and stayed in a beautiful home for an entire week and only spent $1200 total. Most of that was for airfare. They considered this splurging.

$400/month on gas? What the fuck? I commute an hour to work and an hour back 5 days a week, sometimes 6, and have a $150/month gas budget. That is straight up nonsense. Either that brand new car you are paying for is a fucking gas guzzler, in which case you are an idiot for wasting all that money, or that's a straight up lie.

$250/month on clothes!?!?!??!!?!?!?!? WHAT THE FUCK!?!? I don't even spend $250/year on clothes.

$400/month on Children's Lessons? How many things are they learning!? I took Guitar and Piano lessons when I was in high school and only paid $120/month total. All you have to do is research good places that are cheap, and they are everywhere.

So, let's talk about the savings you could be making.

Stop eating fucking caviar ($6000 saving)

Don't waste shit on vacations ($6000 saving)

Get a different fucking car ($2800 saving)

Don't buy new clothes every fucking day ($2500 saving)

Learn to fucking research before just paying ($2500 saving)

All that adds up to almost $20,000/year you are wasting. And you would STILL be living an incredible life in a $700,000 house with a brand new car, having your child going to meaningless lessons, paying for someone else to take care of your child, going on 2 awesome vacations a year, and maxing your 401k contributions.

In which way? Everyone should be insulted? Everyone should be treated with kindness? To me, if you know someone is a non-believer, it's better NOT to try to wrangle them into your beliefs by saying, ""I'll pray for you."" In the rare best case, it might inspire them to listen. In most cases, you're rubbing the non-believer wrong (just a little, but still being a tad impolite)... because they don't share your belief that prayer is a GOOD thing. To them, it's a waste of time, and presumptuous besides. You're basically saying, ""Oh, you lack something I have, so I'll seek supernatural intervention in order to fix you."" Not really polite. And in worst cases, you've (unintentionally or not), just shown them how self-righteous Christians can be. Note, it doesn't matter how you meant it... if you're an atheist and have had this said to you many, many times with clear body language that it's been meant in an insulting way... another time (no matter how well-intentioned) just rubs you wrong.

"> and judging it based on who is willing to accept fast food in place of the cash they asked for is a pretty shitty way to go about it.

As I said: I dont bring cash with me. I figure that if Im serious about this, I should plan how I intend to help. And I've decided that the most reasonable and economical use of the resources I have available is to create care packs with food and dental goods (because who on the streets wants to spend $8 on dental care) and space blankets (because the weather is an actual threat). 

I can get that stuff at prices the homeless cannot-- I can get food in bulk and divy it up, and I can work with my dentist to get free dental care packs, and I can get bulk pricing on space blankets. THat means my $10 is going to hook 5 or so people up with care packs rather than one person.

At the end of the day, as a Christian, I think I will be accountable for how I live my life and how I used my resources. I think that means I should think about this carefully, determine what I have available to help the poor, and determine the best way to allocate that. I dont know that you or the homeless guy is really in a position to judge my finances or how much excess wealth I have. I could share for instance that I am in the middle of renovating a house that is in extremely poor condition (black mold, bad gutters), and that Im not exactly rolling in dough. Giving $10 to homeless people in lieu of food would mean that 2-3 people a month are getting handouts. Instead, I can budget for 30 or more care packs with that same money.

You just said kanan got lucky because he tapped into the force which is complete bs. they duel for about five seconds then kanan just grabs his hand and throws him off the temple like he's some useless stormtrooper. The fact ahsoka left kanan alone with maul shows they were trying to make out kana an maul are at least roughly equals. Maul should be able to stomp kanan in less than 30 seconds at most given what we've seen of both yet ahsoka just leaves kanan to hold him off. She wouldnt of that is kanan was so outclassed by maul. it's not like she'd just hope he got lucky otherwise he's dead.

>Ah I thought you were referring to her very first fight against the Inquisitors.

Yeah i am hense why i said she saved kana and zeb from them. Again if she could have taken them out then she would have it makes no sense for her to drag the fight on in the situation and it just plain stupid. given they were in an empire controlled city.

>Oh really? Frame calcs are inaccurate? Hmm maybe instead of doing that I should do what you did. Blindly assume the bolts shot at Ahsoka are bullet speed ""just because"" with no basis whatsoever. Except I won't because that's stupid. Why would you assume that?
Without frame calcing you have absolutely no basis as to the speed of the bolts. So what do I do? I measure how long it takes for the bolts to cross a particular distance over a particular time. It's simple math. There's nothing fancy done. If it takes a second to cross 5 meters, then it's moving at 5 meters per second. Of course there will be variations but all you need to do is take it like any other form of data. Average it out and discount outliers to provide yourself with a good estimate of the speed.

jesus dude didn't realise i'd hit a nerve... the fact it's simple maths and your finding an average is irrelevant as there is no way the animator measure it at all they'll just have it move across the screen at whatever looks best depending on how far the bolt is travelling ,the angle its moving in relation to the ""camera""and how far away the bolt is in relation to the ""camera"". they aren't going to try and keep them at any sort of consistent speed as long as it looks okay. Just because we have no official answer on how fast blaster bolts are compared to bullets in sw doesn't mean we should jump to some completely unreliable method. It's not like blaster bolts have to be even close to the speed of a bullet for anakin to be able to easily block the bullets one man can fire at him. Anakin stops blaster fire form 100s of droids at once regularly, he has precog, he has way beyond peak human speed and agility. It's absurd to think he'd be overwhelmed by just WS firing bullets at him.

>That's not a valid excuse. If force users have not shown to be FTE, then they're not FTE simple. You can't say ""oh they can move x speed but they slowed it down for us so we can see it"" without a basis. And as far as I know, there is no reason to assume that Star Wars battles are not in real time. I know that characters like Vader and other high-tier force users have moved FTE to other characters briefly but that doesn't mean they're always fighting at that speed.

"> How do people decide now and how do you personally know what is one or the other?

There are laws in place that determine what is and what isn¡¯t - but the more money a company has, the more pressure they can put on a social media website to remove content they perceive as ¡°damaging¡± to their brand (Even if it¡¯s just a parody).

Now imagine government with all of its incompetence and corruption attempting to do this..and it should be incredibly obvious that this will not end well. 

>For now it completely depends on the level of sophistication of the tech. 

100% agree.

..and as can be seen by the latest and greatest algorithms used by a company worth billions of dollars like YouTube - the tech is nowhere near having the ability to use nuance and discernment.


>And do you know ( or think ) it will be one single all encompassing skynet algorithm?

Because the algorithms used only reflect what the humans behind them choose for them to reflect..and part of that is bias.

That bias can be seen in both YouTube and facebooks algorithm, that removes content deemed ¡°hateful¡± or ¡°problematic¡±.

This becomes a problem, because if the bias of the person running the algorithms decides anything that opposes there views falls into these categories..it gets censored.

We¡¯re already seeing this happening everywhere.

>Government's potential misuse of new tech have never stopped us from going forward with developing new technology.

Sure, and now we have the NSA spying on all of us through smart phones, TV¡¯s ect to tighten the governments grasp over citizens actions.

Do you think allowing things to get worse is a good thing?

Just because it was bad before doesn¡¯t mean we should extend it further.

>Do you think we should change paths now and decide what tech to develop based on human intuition?

I think we should avoid enforcing tech through government that has the potential to become tyrannical..but again, that should be obvious to anyone.

>How do you know the algorithms will be more or less faulty, and less sophisticated than a human being making a personal decision based on his/her intuition?

Because I¡¯m basing it on the current billion dollar ones used to moderate the websites I mentioned before..which require constant human intervention.

It¡¯s a perfect example that we¡¯re not they¡¯re yet..and it also doesn¡¯t fix the issue of human bias/corruption. 

If you think an out of touch government will make better algorithms..I have some bad news for you.

>Well that's your personal opinion innit?

..If you completely ignore all the issues I and others have brought up - while also turning a blind eye towards the governments current corruption, sure.

>I, for example, think it's a great idea that has the potential to assist law enforcement towards false claims and straight up lies in a much more effective way than it is now. 

So you want law enforcement to arrest people for lies? 

Yeah..sounds like a great idea..lol.

You talk as if you can't get soda *and* food with food stamps. I've lived on food stamps before. You can get all the essentials + snacks. Pasta, bread, fruit, and veggies are cheap. So is unprocessed meat. You can make a lot with that, so it's what a lot of people will get. People on food stamps eat a lot of grilled cheese, spaghetti, and soup. 

At the same time, you've got a lot of additional money that doesn't roll over into next month if you don't spend it, and kids like tasty drinks. You can get kool aide, pop, syrup for milk, whatever. 

You talk as if it's an either or sort of thing. It isn't. 

The pish poshing from the more well off never ceases to amaze me. People can't use food stamps on fast food, people can't use food stamps on alcohol or tobacco products, people can't use food stamps on anything that has been precooked. There are a ton of regulations already in place. If parents aren't buying their kids food, its because they are being selfish and that won't change if more regulations are put in place. 

I get about $200 a month to spend on food just for myself. My sister is on WIC and gets food stamps. She gets all her formula paid for, diapers, and other things, and is also able to go out and buy herself essentials to keep herself fed. My mother kept me, my sister, and my brother all fed on food stamps while working a 50+ hour a week job and still not making enough to buy us food otherwise.

Don't fucking talk down on people who have to deal with government assistance for food. 


EDIT: And yeah, some people sell food stamps. It's already illegal, people caught doing it already get punished. What more do you want? The ones who do it and buy drugs instead of feeding their families should have their kids taken away period, any type of change to the system that would 'hurt' them would hurt people that do things the right way. 

Also, keep in mind each state's food stamp program is different. Michigan has one of the better ones in the country. It's extremely easy to get put on it. It offers stamps to the homeless and to mothers with very little checkup required, and more or less as long as you're willing to ask the state for help they *will* help you. I've never met a truly *hungry* family in my home state. I've met people who eat the wrong shit and get malnourished, and I've met people who eat too much bad shit and get fat. Hell, immigrant families here are mostly asian (burmese and vietnamese to be specific) and don't' eat any better than the rest of us. 

If the system needs reform, its in how it is sold to the public. Food stamps are essential for a lot of families who could otherwise not feed themselves, let alone their children. Minimum wage in Michigan is below $10/hr, it is going up but the cost of living has been rising even faster and has been for two decades. More and more people in my age group are being forced to move in together or back in with their parents, at an age where a generation ago people were already starting families and looking to buy homes. My sister had to move back in with my mother with her newborn along with her boyfriend because a taco bell manager's pay wasn't enough for them to rent a place or feed their kid. Food stamps keep my niece and them fed.

"The whole lore behind warlocks is that they are secretive and prefer to conduct rituals behind people's backs. The warlock class trainers for Alliance were actually hidden in some obscure places (deep cellar of a Slaughtered Lamb Inn in Mage district in Stormwind, that obscure shack near a small pond of water in Ironforge), reinforcing the idea of a hidden coven practicing forbidden art. Remember how Jaina reacted to Khadgar's manipulation of fel magic?

If you follow the Green Fire questline, a lot of background for new talents, namely new Grimoires, is explained, and how the new demons came to your command. And you follow in the steps of a whole coven, consisting of both Alliance and Horde races, that secretely seeks power. You even defeat the strongest of them to get your green fire. That's the way the warlock heroes can be.

I'm not even sure why warlocks are hated that much. Mages are far more destructive (remember Theramore, it was an arcane magic, not fel), and warriors are actually leading and initiating wars where thousands die. For every warlock doing shit (like Gul'dan) there are 3-4-10-50 other classes doing far more shit.

"**Shorter answer:** Momentum and kinetic energy are not necessarily conserved, and the precise statements regarding their conservation are contained in equations that describe what could possibly cause them not to be conserved. We can obtain similar conservation laws for higher moments of velocity (the third moment is related to heat flow). There are no special names for fourth or higher moments. We usually only work up to the second moment (energy) because the analysis is simpler, and we have to stop somewhere. There is a closure problem with the equations.

---

**Longer answer:** It is certainly true that mass is always conserved in a Newtonian system. But neither momentum nor kinetic energy is conserved in general. The momentum of a particle is conserved if there is no net external force. The total energy is conserved if the particle moves under the influence of a conservative force field (i.e., a force derivable from a potential). Kinetic energy is only one part of total energy and is not separately conserved except in some very special cases. For instance, in a two-body gravitational system, neither momentum nor kinetic energy is conserved. (If the motion is circular, then kinetic energy is conserved.)

Having said all that, you are absolutely right that it's not exactly a coincidence that mass, momentum, and energy are related to the zeroth, first, and second powers of velocity. In a more general setting like kinetic theory, which describes the motion of many particles (say, the gas molecules in some volume) in terms of a distribution function *F*. The distribution function *F* is a function of (**x**,**v**,t), where **x** is the position and **v** is the velocity, and *F* is a probability distribution over so-called phase space. The distribution function satisfies an equation called the Boltzmann equation.

Such a kinetic theory can be reduced to fluid models if we take *moments* of the distribution function and use the Boltzmann equation to simplify. The zeroth moment of F (also called the number density) is just the integral of F, and the resulting equation expresses conservation of mass. (The equation is also called the continuity equation in the context of fluids.) The first moment of F is the integral of **v**F over d**v** divided by the number density (also called **V**, the mean velocity), and you end up getting an equation in terms of **V**. The resulting equation expresses conservation of momentum. The second moment of F is related to the pressure tensor and the resulting equation expresses conservation of energy.

There is nothing stopping you from taking higher moments of F. For instance, the third moment is related to the heat flow, which expresses flow of energy, and the resulting equation is sometimes called the heat flux equation. 

We can keep going to the fourth moment, and so on. (There is no special name for any moment higher than the third moment, as far as I know.) However, it turns out that there is always some variable in the *n*th equation which cannot be solved for without the (*n*+1)th equation. We get an essentially infinite hierarchy of equations. So to have any hope of solving them, we have to truncate the hierarchy at some stage, and then either ignore the variables that need the higher equations or insert an equation of state that is determined from experiment or some other physical insight.

In almost all applications, we just truncate at the second moment equation (conservation of energy). ",0

You may want to Google Stephen Hawking's ""God does not exist"" program.

¡°When people ask me if a god created the universe, I tell them that the question itself makes no sense. Time didn¡¯t exist before the big bang, so there is no time for god to make the universe in. It¡¯s like asking directions to the edge of the earth; The Earth is a sphere; it doesn¡¯t have an edge; so looking for it is a futile exercise. We are each free to believe what we want, and it¡¯s my view that the simplest explanation is; there is no god. No one created our universe,and no one directs our fate. This leads me to a profound realization; There is probably no heaven, and no afterlife either. We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe, and for that I am extremely grateful.¡± ¨D Stephen Hawking

We agree here - and like I said, those examples were just that: examples.  I don't necessarily support one side over another.

That said...

Owning a nuclear weapon doesn't kill anybody either but I don't see people fighting for the right of citizens to own them.  Same situation with fully automatic weapons - they don't kill anyone but there is no fervor or uproar that we cannot buy one today.  The argument to ban sales of those weapons is very easily applied to other weapons once you agree to *any* reason that citizens choices in weaponry should be restricted.  In fact, once you agree to ban any single weapon, you open the door to interpretation to apply that reasoning to other weapons.  The safest, and constitutional reasoning is that **any** weapon ban is unconstitutional...but we have them nonetheless.

It's not a false choice when pregnancy can happen despite efforts to prevent it.  They are called accidents.  They happen.  The reasoning that you should be abstinent is as ridiculous as saying being involved in a car crash is always your fault as well since you should have opted not to drive.  It's my opinion that it doesn't matter if the unborn child is alive or not - if it cannot survive outside the womb, it is (technically) a parasite and the mother should have a right to abort for any reason.  I say any reason because restricting (for example, only in cases of rape) it would not help at all as you cannot prove someone wasn't raped.

I agree on marriage - government should get out of that business and institute some other term for two persons seeking to legally combine their labor/assets.  In fact, just make a new  business entity that can be entered by any two consenting adults that are afforded tax and community property privileges.

On insurance, we currently have the exact system you propose.  Any American is free to purchase whatever insurance they want.  If you want freedom for business - well, that is not the purpose of the Constitution nor should it be.  Businesses do not have rights, people do.  We have laws to govern business such that people can pursue life, liberty and happiness.  Of course, we have laws to protect business - but only to the extent that business can succeed in providing quality goods and services to people.  Laws that restrict business operations may or may not be fair, but they exist and cannot infringe on any 'rights' because businesses do not have rights.

I've never voted to restrict rights of people, only ever voted no (or yes) to expand those rights (or take them away from government).  I vote to allow people vested in society greater voice than an unborn person as long as the unborn person is not viable outside the womb - this means I generally vote to permit abortions in any case, but only when the life of the mother is endangered for late-term abortions.

> Rodgers' manifesto condemns men as much as it does women. The man hated other people.


Did you notice that the majority of his hate was based around women? About how white girls shouldn't be hanging out with coloured men? Yes, there was racist hatred for coloured and Asian men there - but the majority of it was based on the fact that girls were hanging out with *them*, and not him. He was just another 'red pill' type of guy who thought women should be fawning over him because he was such a nice guy - and when they didn't he got angry. 



>Men suffering is not a result of rape culture; this is merely you, and others, co-opting men's issues to bolster your own ideological agendas.


Oh, so men suffering is just a result of other men? Not of the society that women have to deal with? Okay then. And yes, you're right - wanting the same rights and respect as men is *Idealogical*. Sorry, I was obviously dreaming there.



>Why are rape numbers so high? Well, they're not, really.


Um, yes, they *are*. They might be declining, but that doesn't mean they're not still ridiculously high. In New Zealand (where I live, and which has a population of 4.43 million) one *in three* girls will experience some form of sexual assault before they turn sixteen. One in five women will experience it as an adult. That's the statistics for the reported assaults - and only 9% is ever reported. 


> Besides, more men are raped in prison than women are outside of it. Rape is really a men's issue.


If it is a men's issue, then why aren't men fixing it? More men are raped in prison then women outside of it, so why aren't you *doing anything*?! Doesn't that make you angry?! Doesn't that make you sick to your stomach?

The stuff is over prescribed, it is given to children much too young, and it is prescribed by doctors (perhaps like your wife, I don't know), who have absolutely no idea what taking speed feels like. The dopamine rush, the high, the crash, the lows, the ""strung out"" feeling that comes with it, the craving for more of the drug when it wears off, most of these doctors have no idea about any of that because they have never taken the drug. Yet they give it to small children because some data shows that they pay attention more when under the influence of it. It's insane. These people that think it's cool to give it to kids have obviously never been around real drug addicts. 

During my speed years, when I couldn't get meth or coke, adderall was a fine replacement. A very fine replacement. And I am NOT saying that just because I personally abused it, everyone else will too. That is not what I am saying. I'm saying that the drug is extremely dangerous as far as addiction goes. Most people who take something that makes them feel very good, want to repeat the experience. This is how addiction starts. Why play with that kind of fire when there are many other perfectly acceptable AND successful ways to treat the problem? These drugs, even in small, prescribed doses are still very potent stimulants that create a significant amount of dopamine production in the brain. This dopamine surge causes some intense euphoric feelings in the user. It gives a ""rush"" of sorts. Giving our children a buzz like that is not the answer. It just isn't. Maybe somewhere, there are extreme cases where such a drastic measure may be required or at least considered but other than that, no way. The percent of children in this country walking around under the influence of amphetamine is absolutely sickening. You cannot tell me the world needs that many kids on amphetamine. No amount of graphs and charts are going to convince me (or any reasonable human being) that it is necessary to put that many kids on speed. It's a disgrace how easy it is to get it prescribed. An absolute disgrace. Your wife is part of this shameful practice. 

All the people in the world that can be helped by reasonable, sane doctors and then we have idiot quacks, thinking their abilities and power should be put to use shoveling speed into the mouths of children instead of helping people. The problem is, people like your wife don't even think they are doing anything wrong. In fact, they actually think they ARE helping people which speaks for the fact that they aren't necessarily bad people, they are simply misinformed and choose to stick by that misinformation instead of thinking rationally and realizing that most kids who walk into your office, don't need to be on amphetamine. Doctors should have to have a real, personal understanding of addiction and the drug culture in general, before they prescribe amphetamine to someone. They need to at least realize that with something this powerful, even one pill could quickly and absolutely turn into a huge problem for many people.

I HAVE read and read about this stuff. I have read the data and I realize that there are a significant percentage of people who think they were helped by the drug. I also realize that there is a significant percentage of people who know their lives were turned upside down by the drug. I also have personally lived in a house where someone close to me was prescribed it for years. I've also been around numerous people who ended up taking it for fun. Some of those people were prescribed it and some of them weren't. ",0

"Fascinating stuff! 

What I find most relevant to my post is this particular passage of the author's analysis:

>How can this process be ended? Through a shift in perception, caused by the way one attends to feelings, using the categories of appropriate attention [see MN 2]. As the Buddha states in DN 21, rather than viewing a feeling as an appealing or unappealing thing, one should look at it as part of a causal process: when a particular feeling is pursued, do skillful or unskillful qualities increase in the mind? If skillful qualities increase, the feeling may be pursued. If unskillful qualities increase, it shouldn't. When comparing feelings that lead to skillful qualities, notice which are more refined: those accompanied with thinking (directed thought) and evaluation, or those free of thinking and evaluation, as in the higher stages of mental absorption, or jhana. When seeing this, there is a tendency to opt for the more refined feelings, and this cuts through the act of thinking that, according to MN 18, provides the basis for papa?ca.

In essence, by attending to feelings within the context of the Four Noble Truths, one is able to see which feelings are worth pursuing and which are not. A silent mind that supports deep levels of concentration should be found superior to that of a thinking mind.

A quick question about the previous passage: 

>What are these perceptions & categories that assail the person who papa?cizes? Sn 4.14 states that the root of the categories of papa?ca is the perception, ""I am the thinker."" From this self-reflexive thought ¡ª in which one conceives a ""self,"" a thing corresponding to the concept of ""I"" ¡ª a number of categories can be derived: being/not-being, me/not-me, mine/not-mine, doer/done-to, signifier/signified. Once one's self becomes a thing under the rubric of these categories, it's impossible not to be assailed by the perceptions & categories derived from these basic distinctions. When there's the sense of identification with something that experiences, then based on the feelings arising from sensory contact, some feelings will seem appealing ¡ª worth getting for the self ¡ª and others will seem unappealing ¡ª worth pushing away. From this there grows desire, which comes into conflict with the desires of others who are also engaging in papa?ca. This is how inner objectifications breed external contention.

That bonding process ""imprints"" a portion of the Shinigami's soul onto the amalgam (sound familiar), at which point the Asauchi and the imprint together become a true Zanpakuto.  Zanpakuto spirits are the spiritual manifestation of that amalgam.

"> randomness is the lack of pattern or predictability in events

Ah, yes, as I said, this ""arbitrariness"" is not what I'm talking about.  I'm talking about true mathematical randomness, which is 100% predictable, from start to finish, as you can see if you look at Pascal's triangle, and my fabric, which I linked to earlier.  The thing you're thinking of is the more common term that is not actually random, just a more general sense of being unknown/unpredictable.  Rolling dice is totally random, and predictable.  As is everything else, it's just that because we are limited beings, we don't know where we are in the calculation, and thus can't predict/know what will happen next.  

> when a photon is shot at a detector, we don't seem to be able to know or influence what specific spot the photon will collapse to, without physical interaction. that's the randomness copenhagen interpretation claims, but i disagree upon.

Maybe, but who cares exactly which spot a photon is at a precise period of time?  It's not important to life.  What matters is the energy of how things are changing and where things, in general, are going now and in the future.  I mean, it's not important to me whether the 4098729879635th quark from the top left of my elbow is spinning up or down at the 9875419879134875098237450987th (to the 7450982734598723049587th power) millisecond past noon today.  But what is important is the general direction my whole body (a wave, for the most part) is heading.  Am I going into the kitchen, or the bathroom?  But maybe you think it's important to focus on the tiny material details (the photon location), and that's cool, if you want to try to predict where it's going to be, if you want.

"I do, in fact, believe that I should owe more back to society than someone less privileged than myself.
I am not wealthy by American standards, but I am not foolish enough to believe that I didn't have an advantage growing up with a roof over my head and food on the table.  My parents could afford a computer when I was 12, which developed the skills that employ me.  

So, yes, I should have to give back more than someone with less.  I shouldn't get as many social benefits.  
But likewise, I shouldn't pay in as much as someone making twice as much as me, and so on.  

Obviously we can't say ""well this person had absolutely nothing growing up, so we must all have nothing to level the playing field."".

They can survive in the microcosm of San Francisco because there are people here who are willing to spend the extra money to shop at a place with high-quality goods, fair labor standards, etc. Across the street from Rainbow Grocery store is the Food Co, where you go to stock up on Top Ramen packets at a dollar a bushel if you can't afford the organic ones that are two dollars a packet at Rainbow.

My point is, the store does not exist outside of the market dynamic. The reason Wal-Mart replaced hundreds of smaller, locally-owned markets is because it can provide goods at a lower price. This is not a fact that is altered by the internal business practices of the locally-owned market. It does not help them thrive. It does not help to replace the market system of pricing with something better.

> Having a voluntary workmans comp system would break down. No businesses would offer it, no matter how many people want it. 

How do you know that no one would offer it if they weren't forced to? There are plenty of businesses that already offer other types of insurance that they aren't legally required to offer. So what makes you think that no one would offer workers' comp without having to be forced to?


Also, even if it were true that no one would offer workers' comp without being forced to, that doesn't explain why you have the right to force them to offer it. Jessica Alba won't have sex with me without being forced to, but that doesn't mean that I have a right to rape her.

I don't have a right to use your home. So can I delegate the right to use your home to my brother? Or is it just a matter of ""popular consent?"" If I get together with 100 other people, none of which have a right to use your home, and most of us agree that my brother should have a right to use your home, can we then properly delegate the right to use your home to my brother without your permission? Are 100 people not enough? What if we had 1,000 people? Or 10,000? Or a million? How many people would I need to give my brother permission to use your home without your consent?

> You're asking me to be your high school Government teacher...basically...

> Do i have to rehash Jon Locke and Thomas Hobbes? Do you understand the concept of The social contract?

""The social contract"" is a completely made up concept. I never signed or agreed to any ""social contract."" The argument is that I'm passively agreeing to it just by living within a certain geographical region. By that same logic, I could make up a contract that says that anyone who breathes oxygen is agreeing to pay me $10 million a year.

Also, even if I were to accept the ridiculous idea that the social contract is in any way legitimate, that still wouldn't explain why the government is justified in enforcing it with violence. If I enter into a contract with someone that says that they agree to paint my house, can I kidnap them and lock them in a cage if they don't paint my house? Can I shoot them if they resist my attempting to kidnap them?

> The government has legitimacy through popular consent

So something is right as long as it's popular? When slavery was popular, did that make it right?

Like you said, your parents can just do the labor themselves. But thats just owners working for free to keep their companies afloat. I dont really think you can argue that's a significant factor in the labor market. 

Before you said ""a business cant(sic) just not pay for labor if it wants work to get done."" Now you acknowledge that they can. Thankyou for correcting your mistake.

> Wow. Sorry, maybe i should have explained that stat better. 68% of all businesses provide healthcare to their employees. Of the businesses with over 50 employees, 94% of them already provide healthcare to their employees. 

There are a lot of businesses with over 50 employees though. So 6% of every business in the country that has over 50 employees is a lot of jobs.

Also, this pretty much proves that your argument that businesses wouldn't provide workers' compensation without being forced to is horse shit. According to your statistics, 68% of businesses provide health insurance without having to be forced to. So why would you think that they wouldn't provide other types of insurance without being forced to?

Not everyone uses or needs health insurance though. Some people go their entire lives without ever having a medical bill that they can't pay out of their own pocket.

> Again, your problem is the constitution. Specifically the 16th amendment. The government can tax your income. Isnt that something you should be outraged over more so than this?

I never said that I wasn't against taxation. You've just taken it upon yourself to assume things about me that you have no basis for assuming.

Well, I doubt that Obama would have said that, because, for one thing, he'd have better grammar than that. Also, he wouldn't have said that for the reason that he didn't say it, and that was that he would have had to acknowledge that he'd broken his promise to not raise taxes on the middle and lower classes.

I used to be an insomniac - a clinically diagnosed one, not just a teenager with poor sleeping habits - so I would be up playing Call of Duty 4 in my room during the wee hours of the morning. I met a guy (not naming anyone, sorry) in a lobby who I got along with really well, and after a few games he invited me to join a private game with him so we could boost each other (yes, I just openly admitted to boosting, but whatever it was years ago and I have since stopped playing games anyway)... so, after a few nights in a row of socializing over xbox live, we finally exchanged myspace, email and phone numbers, etc... and became really good friends. We lived on opposite sides of the world to each other so we never saw each other in real life. I knew this ""guy"" for years. He had his own problems too, and little to my knowledge his problems were becoming a risk to his life.

One day we were online and he told me his girlfriend was pregnant, which was of course a surprise to me and I was really happy for him. He was already a father of a little girl, and this guy was only young (about 21) so I asked him more. That's when he told me the new child wasn't his. He hadn't slept with his girlfriend in months. He broke down over xbox live and I felt horrible, I just wanted to help this guy out. 

The next day, he wasn't online. But I received an email from him telling me he wouldn't be on xbox live anymore, as he had been kicked out by his girlfriend. In that same email, he told me his father had died of cancer hours before the email. He went on to tell me that I was the only person he could tell because he couldn't trust anybody else. His mother was an alcoholic and had disappeared after his fathers death. 

A week later, I was on xbox live, playing Call of Duty 4 in a private lobby with a few of the ""guys"" friends I had met while playing with him. I asked them where he was, and if he was doing okay...

"supposedly the nine are a race of dark aligned beings but are allied with us and the reef.

recently i saw somewhere that they are or may be humans who were totally altered by the darkness...  though i would consider this to be a slight change/ammendment/retcon to the lore if true because originally it was stated somewhere that the awoken were the farthest the ships fleeing earth were able to get by the time the collapse happened.

the awoken were altered by the darkness partially but not totally because of the outward light from an event or the light of the sun still being strong enough at that distance or whatever no one knows the specifics for sure just that they are a mix of light and dark.

the humans on earth who werent killed during the collapse chain of events are still fully of the light, with guardians able to wield the traveler's light.

the fallen, hive, vex, and cabal are said to be races of the darkness, though this was also stated to be uncertain and postulation because they showed up at or close to the time we were contending with the darkness and because they appeared to want us gone/dead/wiped out.

of those 4 only the hive have been shown to be truly tied to the darkness for certain this far, and there is speculation that is only because of the worm parasites inside them controller them that come from the darkness and need to feed on the light.  the taken being taken from our dimension warped/twisted by the darkness and sent back to fight us being the 2nd confirmed darkness group for certain.

there are signs the fallen used to be good/light oriented and possibly used to be allied with our goldenage ancestors even or traded with them or something...

once we learned more about them, the cabal has always been stated to only be here in the system because they are running from an enemy they are scared of.  presumably this enemy was oryx but we do not know this it could be another enemy or the hive in general or the darkness itself.

the vex were thought to be darkness incarnate and pure evil and according to the exo stranger anyway ""evil so evil it hates other evil""

but now in a mission taking us back to the vault of glass we here a transmission lost to the airwaves of time from the guardian praydeth, who mentions seeing the darkness invading the vault of glass in the past when his fireteam was there fighting them and attacking the vex...so quite possibly the vex werent evil after all or at least weren't dark orginally.

Please show a source on that claim, because I think you are frankly pulling that out of your ass.  A significant portion of society is concerned about this, I think I have demonstrated evidence as such from multiple sources. If you choose to ignore it you simply are deliberately being ignorant.

> True. Unfortunately, if most shared your bias, law enforcement could not function at all. You could have police do something, but not actually enforce laws, with the assumption that no use of force by police is ever justified.

I never said no use of force is unjustified, that is a ridiculous. There is an established line. Some officers have been known to cross it in the past without nearly as much scrutiny and persecution as is occurring today. I welcome body cameras, and cell phone videos. I think it will protect the police and suspects. I still do think there are a great many mean of deescalating some situations where to the point where force is unnecessary, but some officers do deliberately not choose that course. 

> Can you find a story on a police use of force that does not deliberately leave details vague to create an impression not backed up by facts? See the LA Times article above, and avoidance of mentioning the specific detail that the police officers claiming to have administered CPR apparently arrived after the end of the video.

I suspect I can easily do so by linking to any number of sources, but you will likely find a issue with it as you seem to think there is a conspiracy against the truth in the ¡°media¡±, and being unsure of what your stipulations for that are, I feel it would likely be a painful waste of time for the both of us.

> Not in the 4:51 of video i linked to. He stated that he was dragged. He did not state that was before he fired.

He never stated that he waiting until after the car was in motion to fire.


¡°Officer Tensing stated that he almost was run over by the driver of the Honda Accord and was forced to shoot the driver with his duty weapon (Sig Sauer P320).

http://www.uc.edu/content/dam/uc/ucomm/docs/incident-report.pdf

So, I will ask again what was the reason for shooting at the suspect?

> Then you have never actually read the relevant case law

I am familiar with Tennessee v. Garner and Graham v. Connor. While only time and the courts will truly decide, and with the evidence I have seen, I strongly feel that neither the Walter Scott case or the Samuel Dubose case reach the threshold for the use of deadly force. The prosecutors that brought charges against the officers likely agree also. But I suppose you chalk that up to them just sacrificing good cops up for the publicity.

> Possible, but so far all we have are several articles on the same anonymous ""report"" given to the prosecutor's office. There is no indication whether anyone names in that statement corroborated those claims when asked for a formalized statement.

1)  China criminalized philanthropy by nonprofits until only recently.  Grassroots giving was illegal until this decade.  For many years, the only ""charitable"" organizations allowed in China were supposed to be government run by the Communist Party.

2)  Even after the laws against private philanthropic organizing was loosened back in 2004, it was still illegal to raise funds publicly.  This is one of many other stupid restrictions.

3)  Even if you can get around these laws, the historical impact has still been devastating.  A lot of well meaning socially-ambitious citizens have been frustrated at the difficulties in organizing, because the financial, organizational, and logistical expertise and infrastructure necessary to erect and sustain them has been nonexistent due to the lack of prior philanthropic operations to follow and imitate.

However, that is of course all improving gradually.  There's a new middle class today.  Philanthropic projects have been starting up, and total donations by the top donors has of course accelerated since it was first made non-illegal.

"I've never written here before but I love Japan and here are my thoughts:

1) Central defense is a problem. Yoshida hasn't turned into the rock I thought he would after watching him at the Olympics, but I don't think he was particularly bad at the World Cup. Konno, on the other hand, needs to be replaced. He's always been physically limited (like many others on this team) but now he also seems less focused. The challenge for the penalty today was madness and he was sloppy with the ball at his feet. I don't know of any dominant, mean central defenders but hopefully some will make their name soon.

2) The midfield is too easily out-muscled. I think Japan has some of the most technically gifted players in the world but when the holding midfield is comprised of Hasebe/Endo and Yamaguchi/Aoyama, there are naturally going to be problems keeping possession. I think the midfield did a remarkable job of passing it around and keeping the ball against Greece and Colombia but Hasebe and Yamaguchi were overrun on a few too many occasions. If only there was a mean, strong henchman in there too. I'd sacrifice some technical skills if it meant some solidity in front of the backline.

3) No creativity in the final third. The plan seemed to be play it to Nagatomo or Uchida and see if they can put in some good crosses. This was maddening against Greece where anyone could see they were going to win everything in the air. They had to try something else and for some reason they didn't. At the same time...

4) Hesitancy in front of goal. When we attacked, the players seemed focus on getting the best possible look at goal instead of taking shots when available. There were a couple occasions when someone would have space in front of the box and would refuse to shoot, instead playing it out wide for Uchida or Nagatomo.

5) When we did get chances, the finishing was poor. This is more of form thing but I do think we need some more natural finishers in the team.

6) Coaching. Endo as a sub clearly won't work and yet that's what we saw against Greece. Kakitani for two minutes at the end is not enough. But that's what we got. Zaccheroni's adjustments didn't do anything, and what's even more frustrating was that it was clear they wouldn't do anything before he made them.

In communism business owners wouldn't need to be suppressed as the idea of owing a business and basically engaging in capitalism would have been illegal for decades if not more and it would not be possible to get people to work for you if they don't need to to live comfortably. 

Resources would likely be managed and distributed by an organisation such as a politburo. This would originally be part of the state but once the state becomes unnecessary it would be turned over to be organised and run by society for society and thus the criteria would be internally set.

"6. I¡¯m not sure anyone knew if left tackle Jermon Bushrod would be able to gut it out for four quarters.

His back issue is one that is going to be monitored all season and it¡¯s not going to be a surprise if he gets time off during the week each week. He¡¯s probably a good bet to be on the injury report much of the season, if not the entire year. But he¡¯s a pro and he is determined to be out there. The Bears probably left more than any other direction in the running game too and he did well. That¡¯s a positive sign when you talk about a major question mark facing the offense.

7. The last we saw of defensive lineman Jeremiah Ratliff he was hobbled pretty bad with a walking boot and crutches on his way out of Paul Brown Stadium in Cincinnati after the third preseason game. Here¡¯s some good news: Ratliff was moving pretty good in the locker room last week and it¡¯s possible he¡¯s ready to play after his three-game suspension is up the day after the Week 3 game at Seattle.

That¡¯s his goal and Ratliff has been arriving in the training room by 6 a.m. almost every day to get treatment for an injury that had him pretty concerned leaving Cincinnati.

¡°It felt pretty bad but it¡¯s recovering nicely and they¡¯re doing an awesome job here,¡± Ratliff said. ¡°There are no complaints. I am just doing my work every day and working until I get back. I get a head start on the treatment (because of the suspension). I can really treat it aggressively. I am hoping (to play in Week 4 vs. Oakland) but I am just taking it one day at a time. That is definitely the goal.¡± 

NFL rules used to prohibit suspended players from being at the team¡¯s facility during their penalty. In many cases, they can now attend meetings and get treatment. Ratliff simply cannot practice (or play) while suspended.

8. Another injured player to keep an eye on soon is cornerback Tracy Porter. He pulled a hamstring in training camp and then tweaked it again in the preseason game at Cincinnati but says he has been progressing nicely and didn¡¯t rule out being ready for the Cardinals next week.

Porter has a long history of injuries, one general manager Ryan Pace knows well from New Orleans. He¡¯s also played for John Fox in Denver where he was injured but it¡¯s what Pace and Fox remember about him when healthy that has kept him around. When Porter went out, he was running with the starters in the nickel package and that is something to keep in mind. 

¡°They trust and know me,¡± Porter said. ¡°It¡¯s not anything I would expect to be prolonged or carry on. I¡¯ve been making good headway on it and I am hopeful for next week.¡±

9. The Bears will want to thank Cardinals general manager Steve Keim and his scouting staff for safety Harold Jones-Quartey and the job they did finding him when Arizona comes to town Sunday. The Bears claimed Jones-Quartey off waivers from the Cardinals after final cuts. He was an undrafted rookie from the University of Findlay, a Division II school in Ohio. Jones-Quartey made a tackle on special teams and the hope is he can help out special teams coordinator Jeff Rodgers this season.

Jones-Quartey didn¡¯t even play high school football at Horizon Science Academy in Columbus, Ohio. The school was so small it didn¡¯t have a team so he played football for the Columbus Crusaders, a Christian organization.

¡°We basically just played football for fun and all that stuff,¡± Jones-Quartey said. ¡°I wasn¡¯t expecting to get a scholarship. I just wanted to keep playing football as long as I could and it just kind of took off for me.¡±

After playing at Findlay, he attended the Miami of Ohio pro day and that is where Cardinals scout Luke Palko saw him run well. Arizona wound up inviting him as a tryout player to its rookie minicamp. The Cardinals were full on their roster with defensive backs but he played so well, they made room for him on the 90-man roster. From there, he made plays in preseason. Six tackles in the opener against the Chiefs. An interception in the second game against the Chargers. Five tackles against the Raiders. Two tackles and a fumble recovery against the Broncos. If the Cardinals weren¡¯t so deep at the position, he might have made the 53-man roster.

¡°I was a little surprised when they released me but I wasn¡¯t bummed,¡± Jones-Quartey said. ¡°I thought I had a good preseason and I thought I had a great chance of being picked up by someone because I performed pretty well. I just really wanted to play football. This is definitely a blessing and I am going to run with it.¡±

10. The Bears finally opened the locker room at Halas Hall to media this past week and once again players were grouped together by their positions. That¡¯s the way it was during the Dick Jauron and Lovie Smith era before Marc Trestman mixed things up and moved players all around. The idea was to force players who might not always socialize and get to know one another to do just that.

¡°The theory is in sound and that¡¯s what I did in college (University of Nebraska) where the coaching staff wanted to intermingle positions and intermingle races,¡± left guard Matt Slauson said. ¡°So, I get that. But in the professional world there are some things you have to talk about after meetings are done so everybody is on the same page. And when our center was over here and our left tackle was over there and I was way over there, well now I¡¯ve got to take time out of me getting ready (for practice) to go walk over here to talk to (the center) and then walk over there to talk to (the left tackle). Now, I can just do that while I am getting dressed. So it¡¯s much easier.¡± 

And much more professional. Treat professionals like professionals. They are there to work not look for their latest BFF.

10a. The Bears terminated the contract of outside linebacker Sam Acho, who was sidelined with an illness since before the third preseason game Aug. 29 at Cincinnati. The Bears declined to offer any specifics on Acho¡¯s illness and I¡¯ve never seen a team hit with sickness like I have this team. Quarterback David Fales was sidelined for virtually all of training camp after he fell ill a week before the team reported to Bourbonnais. Then, tight end Chris Pantale was sidelined with an illness for at least two weeks during training camp before he was part of the team¡¯s first wave of cuts. That¡¯s three players missing major chunks of time with illnesses. It¡¯s possible Acho, who looked to carve out a role for himself as a core special teams player, could return. He was spotted at Halas Hall on Friday so it¡¯s not like he¡¯s been too far under the weather to be around teammates.

10b. Had not seen first-round draft pick Kevin White since surgery but he did pop his head into the locker room on Friday. White was getting around with the use of one crutch. Consider him out for the season until further notice. 

10c. One of the reasons the Bears signed cornerback Alan Ball was because of his size and ability to get his long arms on wide receivers at the line of scrimmage. Ball missed the part about getting his hands on wide receivers against the Packers. He¡¯s going to need to get better or opponents will be throwing the ball his direction a lot.

10d. Since the Bears called Bruce Arians and told him Marc Trestman would be the coach of the Bears in 2013, he¡¯s 22-11 in the regular season with the Cardinals. Arians didn¡¯t interview in Arizona until the Bears told him no when he was holed up in a hotel room near Halas Hall.

10e. The Cardinals opened as a 2.5-point favorite over the Bears this week at Westgate SuperBook in Las Vegas.

10f. Fox has assigned the broadcast team of Thom Brennaman, Charles Davis and Tony Siragusa to work this coming Sunday¡¯s game against the Cardinals at Soldier Field.

"This struck a chord with me. Drunk moms are not awesome. Some moms might be jovial drunks, quirky drunks, hilarious drunks, whatever. Some moms may be, my mom isn't.

There is a kind of double-standard when it comes to drunk parents. Someone saying ""drunk dads are awesome"" would almost certainly incite at least a couple of ""not until they beat you"" replies from reddit. Someone replying ""no they aren't"" to drunk moms is being down voted.

Here's the thing. My dad is an awesome drunk. I like drinking with my dad, it's a ball. My mom is an abusive alcoholic. She would drink all day, every day, shit herself, all over the house and break all my stuff out of some misplaced sense of spite. She would abuse me, my father, my siblings and my cats and my dogs both physically and verbally. I am a male. My mother would beat me, until I grew large enough to set her straight - the verbal abuse, the blackmail, the rest of it I had to wait until I was old enough to move out. My father never raised a finger towards us kids, he was supportive, trying to help us understand why mother was like this. He wouldn't hit her either, he would sit there and take unbelievable amounts of physical/emotional shit from his wife. My folks are both well-educated, well-employed, upper-class folk. When her drinking problem got out of hand it became very hard to speak out. Everyone is very sympathetic about a drunk, abusive, father in the house. Speaking about your stepford-wife beating you is a lot harder than speaking of a stereotypical trailerdad beating his kids. The cops wouldn't even take it seriously back then. When she physically attacked my little brother we had him sent to a ""young boys home"" or whatever for his own protection. Lets just say growing up sucked a lot of the time.

A galvanized Iran bands with Syria, Palestinian rebels, and several others band together to form the Unified Liberation Offensive, and declare war on Israel, ground invasion begins with air strikes provided by Iranian-owned Russian-supplied aircrafts.  Iraq cuts ties with United States and throws support behind Iran against Isreal.  US and NATO forces clash with Iraqi Security forces.  Afghani  Security Forces turn on remaining US forces.  Both join the ULO.

United States declares war on the ULO (with Congressional approval) and offers Israel full support.  Turkey is used as a platform for US attacks on ULO forces.  Out of nowhere North Korea voices support for Iran defending its Nuclear interests and fighting off oppressors.  North Korea mobilizes along DMZ.  South Korea and North Korea clash along the DMZ, North Korea is more prepared and starts pushing South Korea back down the peninsula.  China begins supplying NK with weapons and even soldiers, Japan enraged by this begins doing the same for SK.  USA offers support for SK and Japan, uses the Phillipines as a hub.

Simultaneously Russia voices support for Iran and by extension ULO.  Supplies Iran with weapons, and mobilizes forces.  When Japan begins supporting South Korea, Russia begins supporting North Korea, providing ""modern"" aircrafts and training for Chinese and North Korean pilots.  

After years of uncertainty, financial juggling, and political mishaps, the entire EU bands together to form a council on foreign affairs.  Germany is given majority power and control due to their overwhelming support of other nations, and their majority power--militarily and financially.   Due to mobilization of Russian forces, and Russia supporting a civil war in Ukraine; Sweden, Finland, and Norway all voice opposition and turn to the EU, NATO, and UN to ensure their safety.  UK has already agreed to back USA, France and Germany follow.

North and Central African countries are pulled towards the ULO because of their heavily Isalamic ties.  South Africa supports Israel and untes with neighboring countries to fend of the incoming Islamic Extremists moving south.  Madagascar closes its ports.

**So we have two major sides here**;

ULO (Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Syria, etc.), Russia, China, North Korea, and various North and Central African nations.

**Against**:

USA, Israel, Majority of EU (France, Germany, UK, Italy, Greece, Norway, Sweden, Finland primarily), South Korea, Japan, Phillipines, and Turkey.

"**WARNING: Long post and spoilers incoming.** 

To start with: Monogatari (Bakemonogatari in particular) is the anime that brought me into anime as a medium. So my words may be somewhat (completely) biased as Monogatari is my favourite series. 

I think Monogatari is all about saying usual things in unusual ways. Remember what Kaiki said to Araragi at the end of Koimonogatari (the last arc of the second season)? ""I did nothing special, just said some obvious things"". It is not about sending the message to us (though the messages are often on spot), but about the way *how* this message is presented to us. Another strong feature is its dialogues. Koyomi and Tsukihi talked for about ten minutes about love at the start of Nekomonogatari, but I was everything but bored. The dialogue was bizzare and had some unexpecting twists in it, but it was always on spot and never went too far from the main point - Koyomi's feelings towards Hanekawa. And this is only one example that came to my mind.

Now I can sing songs of prase to Shaft, but I'll try to make it short: Shaft did amazing, even outstanding job. Even if you end up not liking Monogatari, you know - that anime was something special, out of place, strange, odd. They made it memorable. I know, many were annoyed by all these flashy frames with (almost) meaningless text, but to me it made sense and added some charm, uniqueness. I think it is the best Shaft's visual work for today (SZS is really close, but it is a different story).

Breaking down the series:

**Bakemonogatari** was a complete blast for me. The relationship between Araragi and Senjougahara seemed odd and sincere at the same time. Yes, their relations are somewhat bizzare, but you can completely see *why* they are so strange. While I see Hitagi Crab as an introduction story, Mayoi Shail is where Araragi and Senjougahara interaction is in bloom (by the way, I think it is the best arc in the Bakemonogatari). To say the least - I was moved. Suruga Monkey and Tsubasa Cat are also great, superb stories that were focusing on some other great characters and their (jealosy and hiding the truth from yourself, known problems, huh?) troubles. Only Nadeko Shake was somewhat moderate, but Araragi and Hanekawa dialogue at the library made up for that. Oh, and the soundtrack was something special too. Listening to it once in a while. 

**Nisemonogatari**... well, to be honest, I was disappointed. It is not a bad anime by no means, but it is a step backward comparing to almost-flawless Bakemonogatari. The arcs were good, but not something special and pretty long (large part of the Karen Bee our fellow Koyomi was visiting his harem and just derping). New characters (Kaiki and especially Kagenui and Ononoki) were not quite interesting and deep at that particular moment (however Karen was shown really well). ",0
"A lot of what you ask is difficult or impossible to answer because it's based on wrong assumptions, but I'll do my best here. Note that this kind of thing is better suited for places like r/DebateACommunist, but what the heck.

> I'm asking this question to get a better understanding of communism. I'm going to layout a few facts about myself, and hopefully they can be addressed. Some of these questions are elementary, but I ask them to clear up any confusion I may have.

The biggest confusion here, although in some sense it's just a technicality, has to do with the word ""communism"". Marxists consider communism the last stage of socialism, where to put it simply all the limitations and contradictions of capitalism are finally overcome. According to them pretty much by definition it is *impossible* to get to this point overnight, and this notion informs a lot of their tactics, strategies and ideas. So I'll work with the assumption that some sort of revolution has happened in the US, immediate steps towards socialism have been taken, and we are now living in a society on its way to communism.

> I went to a community college and got my associates degree in IT; I cannot afford to go to a university to get a BA/BS in CS or IT in the US. Would communism pretty much guarantee that I get to advance my education further?

All socialist societies have made a priority universal and compulsory education. So yes.

> I make $30k a year at a major hosting company. What would happen to this hosting company? Would they be 'evaporated'; would they still exist but with less ""power""? It took me 6 months (technically 15 months) to get this job. In communism if I'm out of work, what happens? Am I in a pool of citizens that need a job?

Not all companies would suffer the same fate immediately. All major ones would likely be nationalized, and they would be put to work towards some goal agreed by their workers (who would now have far more control over them) and higher up institutions in charge of overseeing the overall economic development. If your company is a major one I'd say something like that would likely happen.

> I cannot afford healthcare; how would communism address this?

Same as education, universal healthcare would be provided by society regardless of your situation.

> How would companies like Microsoft cope? 

Similar to your own company, it would likely stop existing exactly as it is and transition towards working to achieve actually necessary goals. For instance if a revolution actually happened in the US I'd expect Apple, Google, Microsof et al. to stop competing and duplicating their work and start cooperating to provide affordable and top-quality software and hardware for the US and the rest of the (socialist) world.

> Would open source software like Linux prosper?

Hard to say. I'd imagine free software would have a vital role to play in a modern socialist society though.

> Competing open source software such as Apache and nginx; at a communistic level, what would happen? This question is irrelevant most likely, but curious either way.

That would be up to the people doing the development. Not really that different from today.

> How are ""jobs"" handled? Would I be forced into a job I do not like? Do I have the power to ""choose""?

This depends a lot on the situation. A socialist state would need to balance the private desires of everyone with the need to provide for all society, not to mention the need to regain the ""investment"" made in education. If you spend 15 years studying to be a doctor and then decide you want to be a gardener society has lost a lot of money on you; if everybody does this we'd be in trouble. Also, shitty jobs that nobody wants would probably be subsidized to attract people towards them, and would ideally become a priority for mechanization and automation. In any case, in places like the USSR people were *not* tied for life to jobs they did not want, there was mobility in this regard.

The book ""Towards a new Socialism"" actually goes into quite a bit of detail on the topic of how to properly manage the balance between society's needs, the cost of education, people's desires, etc.

> How are work hours? Do you have ""workers rights""? What are my responsibilities as a worker?

Generally all socialist societies (except for critical situations like wars, famines, etc) had very developed worker's rights. Reasonable work hours, pensions, benefits for parents, insurance against injuries, paid holidays, etc. I remember reading a union representative from West Germany say that every time they bargained with their bosses the whole of East Germany would also sit at the table, since their situation served as an example to compare themselves to.

> Would communism favor public transportation over car transportation? Public transportation is more beneficial and efficient; ideally, what would a communistic society do in this situation?

Depends on the specific situation. I imagine for the US a vast effort to introduce better mass transit would be a very likely scenario.

> We have three major companies in the US: in a communist country how would this work? Would there be one system that is ""open"" for anyone to develop games on?

Games are not a social necessity, so hard to say. I'd expect much more flexibility in areas like this compared to other, more important, production.

"Lets see, there are a fair few:

* GSync handles the lower refresh range significantly better than FreeSync does. It does this by doubling/tripling/etc. frames when the framerate goes below the minimum refresh rate of the panel. This has a twofold benefit. One, it insures that the panel won't be damaged due to a low refresh rate (which can happen if the refresh rate of the panel is too low). Two, it allows you to maintain being in the variable refresh range, no matter how piss poor your framerate at any point in time might be at. FreeSync only currently offers switching to VSync at the low end (which locks you into the low end refresh rate when that bottom threshold is passed, which introduces severe input lag (which is jarring), or no VSync (which means you get tearing).

* Tighter control of the ASIC/FPGA that goes into these panels has ensured that GSync monitors have maintained a larger variable refresh rate window. Most notably with IPS screens. Where you have the MG279Q having only a 35Hz-90Hz variable refresh window, but the upcoming PG279Q GSync panel having a 30Hz-165Hz refresh window. And that Acer (don't remember the exact model number) supporting a 30-144Hz variable refresh range . Many other panels share the same.

* Variable overdrive. This is the most understated feature. But the GSync FPGA has logic to adjust the overdrive moment to match the targeted refresh rate. So significantly better ghosting reduction during variable refresh operation.

* ULMB, which although this isn't GSync, is an inclusion in the models that can support the required refresh rate and pixel response times.


So go ahead, downvote me all you like. I'm just stating factual stuff about each technology. I don't doubt that FreeSync might overtake GSync in the future. But as of right now, the only thing FreeSync offers is the POSSIBILITY of being better than GSync.

Now whether those very real, physical benefits of GSync are worth the price increase, that is completely up to the person that is paying the money required to purchase the monitor. And right now, ",0

Do you have a vested personal interest in Gender being a complete social construct? I get it, some people have developed an identity around being who they are, because they want to be that person, and in the sense of societal gender roles, that's totally true and valid.

But when it comes to gender identity, and why we are who we identify as, there ARE physiological reasons for it(there is a physiological reason for everything that a human does or thinks, we are just a big chemical reaction after all), and the brain IS physically dimorphic. It's logical to say that there is a connection between that dimorphism, and dysphoria, especially with things like phantom limb syndrome in trans people, and brains that match the gender they identify as in multiple studies.

"On the question of whether the buildings were brought down with explosives, here's all you need to know about that: no freaking way. When you see one of those cool building implosion things that companies like Controlled Demolitions, Inc do, you're not seeing the real work there. Before they pushed the button and set off those explosives, a team of structural engineers with the original blueprints went through the building and completely gutted it, so that it was just BARELY standing on its own. And then they use really a surprisingly small amount of explosives to kick the slats out, and gravity finishes the job.

Now the REASON they use so little explosive is not because they're cheap--quite the opposite, all that gutting work costs WAYYY more than a ton of TNT. No, they use teensy amounts of explosive so they don't destroy the entire freaking city. There are typically buildings all around the building to be demolished that people would like NOT damaged. And explosives emit tremendous overpressure waves that turn everything in a serious radius to dust and jelly. And those waves spread out in a sphere around the explosion. So if they used explosive force to destroy the building, instead of gutting it and giving it a nudge, you'd break every window on a mile radius and turn people into chunky salsa. And that's generally considered A Bad Thing on a building site.

So, you wanna bring down the WTC with explosives? Groovy. You got precisely TWO choices:

1) Spend months gutting the buildings, busting through load-bearing structures, knocking out walls and ceilings. How you do that in TWO occupied buildings without anyone getting suspicious is an exercise left for the deranged. Then you wire up explosives in just the right places, arrange for four airline hijackings, secret government hit teams, all that other stuff as a diversion, then push the button, and hey presto! The buildings collapse just like you saw on TV...except, of course, the rubble would be missing MOST of the building's interior structure because it had been ripped out and hauled away (presumably smuggled out in backpacks and brief cases).

"At different eras in world history there have been sacred figures who, while apparently of flesh and blood, have been elevated to inhabit a special realm of near-divinity above the rest of fallible mankind.

In medieval China, they had the Ming Emperor, Lord of Ten Thousand Years, who employed the Mandate of Heaven to decide the fate of millions. His person was held to be inviolable and without imperfections. Those who dared to question his rule were flayed alive, their skin left hanging from a hook to emphasise the emperor would brook no challenge to his authority.

In contemporary Britain we have Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, who employs control over interest rates to decide the fate of millions. His position is held to be independent and without any error. And so any criticism of his actions is regarded as a thought crime ¡ª and those who dare to question his rule are flayed in the press with dire warnings left hanging in the air to emphasise the governor will brook no challenge to his authority.

The latest politician to be rebuked by the governor is the prime minister who, in what was clearly an inappropriate step for the first lord of the Treasury, presumed to offer an opinion on economic matters.

The governor took exception to Mrs May devoting a section of her speech at the Conservative Party conference to monetary policy. Her crime was to point out that while ¡°super-low interest rates and quantitative easing provided the necessary emergency medicine after the financial crash, we have to acknowledge there have been some bad side effects. People with assets have got richer. People without them have suffered. People with mortgages have found their debts cheaper. People with savings have found themselves poorer.¡±

For most of us listening this was about as controversial as asserting that water would certainly wet us and fire would certainly burn. Quantitative easing ¡ª and indeed the latest misjudged interest rate cut ¡ª have created significant economic problems. The prime minister was simply acknowledging the obvious and pledging, rightly, to address policies that generate inequality.

But for the governor, this was an act of l¨¨se-majest¨¦ and dangerous heresy. The prime minister was no more entitled to talk about the economy than I would be to undertake brain surgery. As he explained, ¡°the policies are done by technocrats. We are not going to take instruction on our policies from the political side¡±.

Technocrats. Has a nice ring to it, doesn¡¯t it. The very phrase, with its connotations of sleek efficiency and Silicon Valley, is meant to suggest that we¡¯re talking about some kind of upgraded version of our species ¡ª a sort of Human Being 2.0. Just as Homo sapiens has lost the thick body hair that marks out other primates, it¡¯s implied that technocrats have shed the biases and prejudices that mark out lesser humanoids.

Except that if one actually takes the trouble to look at something as inconvenient as the economic evidence staring us in the face, it seems that technocrats have been about as much an improvement on boring old politicians as tower blocks were on Georgian terraces.

It¡¯s the technocrats ¡ª those who scorned public opinion and asked us to trust the special expertise that only a background in international banking or academic economics can achieve ¡ª who have brought us the disaster of the euro, the immiseration of the Greek people, record youth unemployment in Spain and Portugal, unsustainable property booms and then crashes in Spain and Ireland, the weakening of Germany and Italy¡¯s banking structures and a massive transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich. Oh yes, and a total failure to either predict, provide for or prevent the financial crisis of 2008.

1) Underexperienced system administrators in the 90s vs Underexperienced system administrators in the 201x's:

In the 90s, we went on IRC, newsgroups, and RTFMd. IRC was more often than not a rather hostile environment. Thank fuck that shit is over with. Maybe it's because we can't see each other's IP addresses and username, or maybe it's because we're a little more mature, either way, if you went into #Linux and asked any sort of question, you had two possible scenarios:
  a) At least 10 people probe your computer looking for misconfigurations, log in and fuck with you
  b) At least 10 people pipe up to say ""RTFM LAMER""

So we went to various websites and again, newsgroups to get information which was crude and very technical, so in the end we had to do a lot of low-level experimentation in order to understand why something needed to be configured a certain way. 

I never touched windows until I had a ""real"" job, and as a colleague once said, ""You just click random shit until it starts working."" - but that's the Google Age, which brings me to now:

Information is practically free. Everyone blogs about how to configure X Y and Z, and everyone else reposts those blog posts on their own blogs. IRC is even friendly. And of course, everyone's favorite massive message board, Reddit has enough people dedicated to networking and sysadmin, and everything else that it's just *too damn easy* to hop online and start asking questions to *live* people rather than find blogs, or find documentation, or find existing examples. 

If you're a new sysadmin developing in the 2010s then I think you're predisposed to take advantage of what the internet has to offer, and realistically, this is what it offers - convenient, live people.

Print Page

Most of Martin Scorsese's films have been about men trying to realize their inner image of themselves. That's as true of Travis Bickle as of Jake LaMotta, Rupert Pupkin, Howard Hughes, the Dalai Lama, Bob Dylan or, for that matter, Jesus Christ. ""The Departed"" is about two men trying to live public lives that are the radical opposites of their inner realities. Their attempts threaten to destroy them, either by implosion or fatal betrayal. The telling of their stories involves a moral labyrinth, in which good and evil wear each other's masks.

The story is inspired by ""Infernal Affairs"" (2002) by Alan Mak and Andrew Lau, the most successful Hong Kong film of recent years. Indeed, having just re-read my 2004 review of that film, I find I could change the names, cut and paste it, and be discussing this film. But that would only involve the surface, the plot and a few philosophical quasi-profundities. What makes this a Scorsese film, and not merely a retread, is the director's use of actors, locations and energy, and its buried theme. I am fond of saying that a movie is not about what it's about; it's about how it's about it. That's always true of a Scorsese film.
This one, a cops-and-gangster picture set in Boston rather than, say, New York or Vegas, begins with a soda fountain scene that would be at home in ""GoodFellas."" What is deliberately missing, however, is the initial joy of that film. Instead of a kid who dreamed of growing up to be a mobster, we have two kids who grow up as imposters: One becomes a cop who goes undercover as a gangster, and the other becomes a gangster who goes undercover as a cop.

Matt Damon is Colin Sullivan, the kid spotted in that soda fountain by mob boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). He enlists in the state police after Costello handpicks him so many years before as a promising spy. Leonardo DiCaprio is Billy Costigan, an ace police cadet who is sent undercover by Capt. Queenan (Martin Sheen) to infiltrate Costello's gang. Both men succeed with their fraudulent identities; Colin rises in the force, and Billy rises in the mob.

The story's tension, which is considerable, depends on human nature. After several years, both men come to identify with, and desire the approval of, the men they are deceiving. This may be a variant of the Stockholm syndrome; for that matter, we see it all the time in politicians who consider themselves public servants even though they are thieves. If you are going to be a convincing gangster, you have to be prepared to commit crimes. If a convincing cop, you have to be prepared to bust bad guys, even some you know. Protect your real employers and you look fishy. ""The Departed"" turns the screw one more time because each man is known to only one or a few of the men on the side he's working for. If Billy's employer, Capt. Queenan, gets killed, who can testify that Billy is really a cop?

Ingenious additional layers of this double-blind are added by the modern devices of cell phones and computers. When the paths of the two undercover men cross, as they must, will they eventually end up on either end of the same phone call? When the cops suspect they have an informer in their midst, what if they assign the informer to find himself? The traps and betrayals of the undercover life are dramatized in one of my favorite moments, when one of the characters is told, ""I gave you the wrong address. But you went to the right one.""

Although many of the plot devices are similar in Scorsese's film and the Hong Kong ""original,"" this is Scorsese's film all the way because of his understanding of the central subject of so much of his work: guilt. It is reasonable to assume that Boston working-class men named Costigan, Sullivan, Costello, Dignam and Queenan were brought up as Irish-American Catholics, and that if they have moved outside the church's laws, they have nevertheless not freed themselves of a sense of guilt.

The much-married Scorsese once told me that he thought he would go to hell for violating the church's rules on marriage and divorce, and I believed him. Now think of the guilt when you are simultaneously (1) committing crimes and (2) deceiving the men who depend on you. Both Billy and Colin are doing that, although perhaps only a theologian could name their specific sin. A theologian, or Shakespeare, whose advice from Polonius they do not heed: ""To thine own self be true, and it must follow, as the night the day, thou canst not then be false to any man.""

Another amateur theologian, Hemingway, said it's good if you feel good afterward, and bad if you feel bad afterward. Colin and Billy feel bad all of the time, and so their lives involve a performance that is a lie. And that is the key to the performances of DiCaprio and Damon: It is in the nature of the movies that we believe most characters are acting or speaking for themselves. But in virtually every moment in this movie, except for a few key scenes, they are not. Both actors convey this agonizing inner conflict so that we can sense and feel it, but not see it; they're not waving flags to call attention to their deceptions. In that sense, the most honest and sincere characters in the movie are Queenan (Sheen), Costello (Nicholson), and Costello's right-hand man, French (Ray Winstone, that superb British actor who invests every line with the authority of God dictating to Moses).

It's strange that Jack Nicholson and Scorsese have never worked together, since they seem like a natural fit; he makes Frank Costello not a godfather, not a rat, not a blowhard, but a smart man who finally encounters a situation no one could fight free of, because he simply lacks all the necessary information.

In addition, if she's willing to completely betray Thordak for her own reasons, VM probably thinks she's just as likely to double-cross them once he's out of the way.

Raishan has picked a very good time to come forth. She has VM by the short hairs: while she knows a great deal about Thordak and his plans (likely), she also knows an equally great deal about VM. She knows where Whitestone is, she knows they are on a timeline, and she knows that timeline is about to run out. Also, the timeline is exacerbated by Percy's resurrection penalties which are likely going to take up the rest of it for him to fully recover.

On top of that, she's an ancient green dragon with considerable magic skills, and VM is in no condition to fight. The deck is stacked considerably in her favor, whether VM likes it or not.

I am of the opposite opinion though.

I know we have the right to defend our EEZ BUT in this case, a diplomatic approach would have been far better than sending the goddamn navy after them. Or at least, just send the coast guard. Sending the navy is kind of an act of war, note that what defended the fishing vessels were not ships of the PLA Navy.

Right. The US did terrible things to our country decades ago. But they've also given us significant amounts of aid since. China, meanwhile, continuously harasses our fishermen, uses our country as a dumping ground for their narcotics, and is currently destroying our natural resources by building islands on top of coral reefs. And this is happening right now. Today. Surely these actions should raise some serious red flags (no pun intended)?

The aid isn't reparation, and besides, how do you define significant? U.S. government aid is a drop in the bucket of our current economy. China is not treating us well too, but let me tell you the difference. 

We're friends with the U.S. and they treated us like shit ever since they annexed all our islands despite us having a functioning democratic government. They treated us like shit and murdered hundreds of thousands of us, and treated us even shittier by making us forget about that. They treated us like shit when they refused to extend the right to a jury to the Philippine islands despite this land being under the U.S. constitution, because the ""people were not ready."" The Japanese treated us worse so we welcomed the Americans back, but then they go around and treat us like shit and force the Bell Trade Act up our asses. Communist revolution brewing? They fucking support a kleptocrat dictator and welcome him to the White House, ensure shenanigans like the Jabidah massacre get covered up. And how about the fact that some rogue agent of the Feds gets caught just a decade ago, in Davao, with explosives, probably trying to set up a false flag operation. They're still meddling with our domestic affairs, and that country is ostensibly our greatest ally ever.

"I'm a law student who is currently taking an Administration of Criminal Justice course (basically constitutional criminal law). We're talking about 4th Amendment issues right now. I'll email this to my professor and see what he has to say. 

Edit: I've emailed my professor and included a link to the picture. I'll spot an update if and when I hear back from him.

ReEdit: I talked to my professor and he asked me to bring it up in class. The key issue is whether the card is left in the car or like under a wiper blade which I don't think we know . I'll update when appropriate. 


ANSWER FROM A LAW PROFESSOR: I just brought this up in class and we discussed it. This assumes that the card was left *inside* the car. (If the card was left under a wiper blade then it's ok.) The following is a paraphrasing of my Professor's conclusion given the facts we have.

Yes, there is a physical intrusion so it would seem to be a search and, therefore, against the 4th Amendment. However, since the car is unlocked there is no expectation of privacy. No expectation of privacy means no invasion of privacy. This would also fall under the police's duty to protect and serve. The police are not searching and seizing, they are protecting citizens. This is similar to a beat cop in an urban setting checking to see if shop doors are locked.

If the officer were to see, for example, an automatic weapon, which is clearly illegal, the search would be improper because the officer did not have lawful entry. This assumes that the automatic weapon was only visible by opening the vehicle. 

Moral of the story: Lock your damn doors.

Quite correct -- in fact, if the Bible has a position on slavery, it's that slavery is just fine, so long as you don't outright kill your slave. It's ok to beat them so badly that they die after a few days, though -- as long as they live for a day or two, you're fine.

"I replied above with what I think a proper reading of the verse should be. I will add though that you picked a particularly slanted translation. 

>  And how does it address the many evil and tyrannical leaders if it supports their rule without question? 

I think the key to reading the passage is recognizing that the use of ""governing authorities"" is a different word than ""rulers"". The greek word of rulers (archon) is pretty clearly a state, but the word for ""governing authority"" is different than archon. So what is meant by ""governing authority"" is clearly something different than the state (archon). If they meant archon, then they would have said archon.

Therefore the only reference to hitler is where it says:

* For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended. 

This doesn't suggest that we owe anything to the state. It's saying the state can not bring terror upon good people. The state does indeed make everything a crime nowadays, so as to make it appear they are fighting evil. ",0

"I don't know, I've never worked in service industry, and most of my friends are in academia or programming. But from what I observe, there are these factors:

* There is a societal expectation of good service. If a company doesn't provide a good service, company suffers; so the companies are very much interested in keeping an appropriate level. This can go to ridiculous degrees, like daily morning motivational meetings with smiling practice for the whole staff.

* People take pride in doing their jobs well, whether they're cooks, servers or administrators, and ""doing their jobs well"" is mostly defined as keeping the customers happy. Again, this can go to ridiculous extremes, like always walking in a half-run to give appearance of swiftness and busyness. A perfect non-service example is, whenever I asked a passer-by something like ""Where is the post office?"", the answer would almost invariably be ""The post office? The post office is... well... let's see, the post office... It should be... I think... maybe ovvveeerrr th.. no, no, no... the post office... where was it again... hmmm... right, the post office... I'm sorry, I don't really know."" Duh. It can be annoying... but they have to show that they're treating your question seriously, putting in the effort, and not brushing you off.

There's Japanese who have jobs which are unimaginable in the west, because a) noone would pay them, b) noone would accept them. One of those is, for lack of a better word, pointer - people standing around and pointing people where to go, or not to go. An elevator on my metro station was under repairs for about a month. There was a little fence both on the street level and on the lower level, very obviously showing people that they can't use the elevator. But in addition, both above and belowground, there was permanently a person standing there, saying how the elevator was out of order, pointing people towards the stairs and apologising for the inconvenience. For a month. From 5am till 1am, the whole time the metro is operating. I've actually never seen a pointer move, I suppose aside from shift changes (I don't even know what they do with bathroom breaks). They look almost as serious about their job as a Buckingham Palace guard.

The point is, I won't ever worry if someone spit in my food. I will always be welcomed with a smile (even if a fake one, at times, but you'd never know). I will always be addressed with extra-polite speech. I will be returned any change, to the last yen, and if I tried to give them some I will be refused. (I think. I didn't try. I heard stories about waitstaff running after customers down the street with their ""forgotten money"" in hand.) I am never offered any suggestions unless I ask for one - the menu is there, plain for everyone to see, and anything I as a customer want, this is what they will bring me, expensive or not. (You get hawking for extra stuff in other places, like mobile phone companies, but I haven't yet gotten any from servers.) The waitstaff is usually quick to respond, and the food is brought out promptly.

I definitely got spoiled here. There is a factor of a different cuisine, but just this week I was at a restaurant for lunch and I was like ""OMG, it's been 20 minutes already since we ordered!"". Back in my original country I would not even blink at waiting 20 minutes for food to arrive.

There are differences in staff quality, definitely. I think they mostly correspond to what kind of place it is. Mom and pop places will normally serve only a small variety of things but be extremely good at them. Higher class restaurants will make you feel like princes, and they can explain every little detail. On the other hand, some part-time staff working in a chain restaurant will have to go and ask someone higher-up if asked if the free tea they give to every table is a green tea or barley tea.

Incorrect.  Lessig himself agrees a crime was probably committed.  Lessig's position is that it shouldn't even be defined a crime, or at least, it should not be considered a felony.  Here are Lessig's words:
> First, of course, Aaron brought Aaron here. As I said when I wrote about the case (when obligations required I say something publicly), if what the government alleged was true ¡ª and I say ¡°if¡± because I am not revealing what Aaron said to me then ¡ª then what he did was wrong. And if not legally wrong, then at least morally wrong. The causes that Aaron fought for are my causes too. But as much as I respect those who disagree with me about this, these means are not mine.

> But all this shows is that if the government proved its case, some punishment was appropriate. So what was that appropriate punishment? Was Aaron a terrorist? Or a cracker trying to profit from stolen goods? Or was this something completely different?

Moving on...

> ""Intellectual property"" is a made-up term with no real meaning.

Wrong.  First, for purposes of legal adjudication, the case law clearly establishes that IP is property.  Second, the fact that people are willing to pay for JSTOR access is proof positive that it is a sort of valuable property.

"Not looking for pity, just need an outlet I guess. I realize haven't been well mentally in a very long time, never had much of a family or many friends, my dad didn't want me and left, lots of stupid and sad stuff, etc. It became worse when I moved probably over a thousand miles from everyone I ever knew after losing my home, job/business and means to going to college. 

After moving to this new area, I've been basically in seclusion for 9 years now while honing my craft and making money from it. I developed online friendships and became attached to these people more than any real friends or family I ever had. It was easier to be myself and have no regrets. I didn't get embarrassed by people anymore, or have people try and pick fights with me, I changed from a violent person to someone who just wanted to be left alone. I was at peace for a short while, but still very lonely.

 A few years ago, I developed feelings for someone online who wanted me as a partner after talking for a few years, they were aggressive in a way and lobbied for us to be together. I never had someone go after me in a way, but this person was everything I wanted in a SO, we had a bond that we both never had before with anyone else. This other person wasn't exactly in good health mentally as well and faced their own demons, but we cared about each other deeply, we both just wanted someone to accept us for who we were unconditionally, someone to love us. 

After falling on hard times this year, they were there for me as anyone could be living 2000 miles away. My health started going south and I could no longer work until I got well. During this period, our plans to meet fell apart, and so did the person's feelings for me apparently, they thought I maybe took them for granted, when this person was on my mind 24 hours a day. Maybe I didn't do enough, it's all that clouds my mind now, any declarations of feelings or gifts from the heart are met with being completely ignored nowadays.

Now I'm in a complete downward spiral. I have panic attacks every day, multiple ones every few hours, it drives me to the brink of tears and I don't know what to do. All I can think about are all the people who have abandoned me in my life and how I'm not worth loving or being cared about, when I tried to show them otherwise. I've been around to listen to anyone's problems and help them in most any way, but as I feel this way I find no one is there or will make time for me. I feel used, unappreciated, and thrown away.

"[](/ajcry) Well, not a parents episode like I and many were expecting. Shame. Maybe next season? 

[](/sp)

[](/ajfrown) Regardless, this episode puts me in a bit of a weird place. Honestly, story-wise, I wasn't very impressed with this episode. Just kind of your standard web-of-lies storyline. Some funny moments here and there I guess, but really nothing to write home about. I guess there's the interesting framing as the family telling Apple Bloom a story, but it's not really utilized throughout the episode, just a means to set up the flashback and deliver a pretty nice scene at the end that was really the best part of the episode, Apple Bloom's interpretation of the moral and getting out the cider for the older three and all, that was a sweet ending. Maybe if they had cut back to the family telling the story once or twice during the flashback it would've given them the chance to take more advantage of this framing device, but as is it's at least unique. 

[](/ajlie) And I do like how it sort of show that AJ wasn't always the perfect element of honesty she is now, and that she's made some kind-of embarrassing mistakes too, and how they shaped her into the pony she is today. That was kind of interesting to see, get a little backstory. Same with Big Mac and his speaking/lack thereof. I like that that's a legit character point of his now and not just a joke.

[](/sp)

[](/absmile)Going back to the ending scene and Bloom spouting the moral, I like how she interpreted it a little differently than ""lying is bad"", but rather ""we all make mistakes and that shapes who we are"", which for Apple Bloom's arc specifically is a much more fitting moral, and helps set her apart from just being a younger clone of her older sister, who took the moral of the events that transpired as the simple ""don't lie"" moral. That was a great way to present the moral and I really liked it.

[](/sp)

[](/ajhappy) Not to mention, we got a flashback to a time period we haven't seen yet; when the Mane 6 were teenagers, post-cutie mark but pre-pilot. That was nice, even if AJ was the only one that appeared.

[](/sp)

[](/abmeh) But that's about the extent of interesting things there is to say about the episode proper. Aside from some key scenes and elements, it was still a lackluster story overall.

[](/sp)

[](/abhuh) But now we have to get into two things that piqued my interest about this episode that had little bearing on the story but by far are the most interesting things to talk about.

For one: their ages and Apple Bloom's birth. See, I'd always assumed (and though the general consensus was) that the Mane 6 were in the early 20's range (",0

2) being an atheist is not very scientific, since you dont have a solid reason, nor a proof, for your beliefs. your position is unjustified as a result
3) as the above was quite easy, a more interesting option is to take up an agnostic position. since then, we have an open-minded person who doesnot know which side to be on. then we can have a more intersting discussion of what seems more plausible.

Yeah, actually we do. We know that 2+2=4 because we have consistent evidence that this is true. You take two apples, you pair them with two apples, the result is always the same. Evidence.

>""A bachelor is an unmarried man"" is true without the use of evidence.

No, it isn't. ""Bachelor"" is the term we use to describe a concept. We have evidence that this concept of an unmarried man exists. So, we label it. 

>One day a black swan came about and the claim was amended.

But, until they actually had evidence of a black swan, the claim ""black swans exist"" was unsupported by the evidence. Without that evidence, we would have no reason to believe that claim.

>The evidence overwhelmingly supported the claim that all swans were white, but was not at all truthful.

Correct. Which is why there is a difference between ""I don't believe x is true"" and ""I believe x is not true.""

When I say I don't believe god exists because I have insufficient evidence to support that belief, I am not saying ""I believe God does not exist because all the evidence points to him not existing.""

Again, without sufficient evidence, the belief in a God is unwarranted. If there is some other method for determining god's existence, other than the examination of evidence, that method needs to be presented. And, it needs to be demonstrated why that method is reliable.

The bible says that to spare the rod means you hate the child because you are not disiplining them but to use the rod means you love them because you are teaching them valuable lessons. Some of the qualities are exhibited in different amounts at different times. Obviously if you are spanking a child you would be showing less kindness (though maybe you would show still much kindness by using a paddle instead of something more painful like a razor strap).

"You don't understand - you are assuming that TERF's 'hate' any group - but WE are the ones who infer that their behaviour is hate. Consider this - your evidence that TERF's hate men is that they exclude them from Women's spaces like they do men. This requires you to have already assumed that TERF's hate men. There are many reasons to exclude men from a women's space - the hate comes in from their refusal to take account of that persons decision to change their gender. This is not something that TERF's could do to cisgendered men, so you must provide more evidence that they hate men.

> If you don't view men as ""the other,"" then it simply doesn't matter what your radical views on gender are; you wouldn't view trans women as encroaching onto ""women's space,""

This is your real argument, and it has nothing to do with Trans people. You object to women having separate spaces at all, since Feminists are quite explicit about the need for women's only spaces. It is unneecessary to bring Trans people into it - TERF's are just a particularly hateful form of a group who hates men in this view. I disagree that women's spaces are evidence of feminists hating men, or treating them as 'the other' - for reasons I outlined in my last point. In fact - I am a man, how can I (being a feminist) treat myself as 'the other'? Is that not a contradiction in terms?

> because you would think ""male"" and ""female"" spaces shouldn't actually exist as false dichotomies of an inherently gendered system. 

Perhaps, but we live in a society where women are the majority of the victims of gendered abuse, and excluded from political and economic power - if we lived in a completely equal society, you might have a point. Until we do, women are going to need their own spaces. 

> A rather large one, and two if you include /r/feminisms. But in any case, I'm not particularly worried about the ratio of TERFs to other feminists. 

Fine, whatever - it's clear that they do not represent mainstream feminist thought. I mean, Trans people are treated pretty badly by ALL of society - shouldn't we applaud the fact that the majority of feminists are supportive of trans issues, and that feminist gender theories have contributed much to the trans movement, instead of focusing on the hateful group (that is present throughout society).

Domestic abuse statistics? Rape statistics? Everday Sexism project? How about look into history like, 50 years? Are you really denying that women, who make up half the human race and were excluded from voting for most of America's history, who were considered property until far too recently, who still are treated in this way in other places, experience more sexism than men - the historically more powerful group, who have committed the majority of rapes, the majority of domestic abuse, held exclusive power for most of history, and still do in some places across the world?

> coherently define the terms in 2 

Ok - we live in a representative democracy. The majority of politicians are men. The majority of CEO's of companies are men. The majority of the owners of capital are men. The majority of millionaires and billionaires are men. America has never had a female president. Are these not coherently defined terms? These are all what I (and most people) would consider political and economic power - so how do men not clearly still hold the majority of political and economic power.

> and then substantiate it

There is just a ridiculous amount of evidence for this - look up the proportion of women in the house and senate, consider that every single president has been a man. Look up the proportion of male and female CEO's, the proportion of male and female capital ownership. I'm not gonna find these things for you - it is just obvious.

> to what extent they are and to what extent these things matter in the grand scheme of moral philosophy. 

This is ridiculous - you don't think there is something morally wrong when women, who make up half of the population, are represented within a democratic system far less than men, and have far less ownership of capital and control of business within a capitalist system? The only way you can possibly justify this is in thinking that women deserve not to be represented - which is sexism, plain and simple.

> It's hard to say what ""their"" aim is, because ""they're"" composed of a bunch of different entities and conflicting views, terms, definitions, outlooks, philosophies, plans of actions, etc. 

Not really - the disagreement is in things like 'method,' where to focus, who to consider women etc. - but all feminists agree on basic premises. 1. Women have historically experienced, and continue to experience, disadvantages on the basis of their gender, and 2. This should be changed.

I bought my laptop because I needed one. I shopped for one that best suited my needs at the best price. Same for my condo, my furniture, the services I purchase daily, my wifi, and my food. The odd time some advertising may make me aware of a product I didn't know existed. I don't buy it willy nilly.

>That's such a dodgey non-answer. If someone took shortcuts that hurt you or a loved one badly, I don't think you'd be shrugging off blatant immorality so easily

I meant it seriously. The great thing about living in a country like ours (I live in Canada, still a free, western democracy) is that you can do pretty much whatever you want. I just don't think other people should obligated to pay for any poor choices that you may make. But if working in a lower paying profession for greater personal satisfaction is what makes you happy, I sincerely advise you to do so. Besides, blatant personal or corporate negligence is against the law. I don't think anyone advocates for a lawless society, besides ancaps and hardcore socialists

>No, you very obviously are not. If your mom drank while she was pregnant with you, or someone fucked up and leeched lead into your water supply, or your town got blown up by a civil war, or you were born with some crippling genetic condition, or any number of other things, you're going to be put in a shitty place through absolutely no fault of your own

This is a minority of circumstances. Still part of the hand you're dealt, though. You can simply look at the Jews if you want a to find a group of people that excels at overcoming hurdles not of their own making. Of course, this doesn't mean we shouldn't have laws against negligence.

>Less sarcastically: money does buy happiness, especially if you're poor. Money is necessary for good health, since you need to afford good food, get good medical care, etc. Money is necessary for safety, because it's what gets you out of shitty, dangerous neighborhoods and pays for someone to guard your community. And money is necessary for happiness, because no one is happy when they're stressing out over how to pay a bill every week.

Studies show that no, money doesn't increase happiness past a certain point, I concede that. But I don't think the answer is to give people stuff. Again, I'm not against basic welfare, but we shouldn't just give people stuff. In fact, I'm more in favor of programs that provide the tools necessary for poor people to pull themselves out of poverty. Things like means tested college subsidization. Actually, I recently read that the way the UK has been conducting their secondary schooling has been working well, although I haven't looked into it to a great extent yet.

Allow me to make the your argument for you. Instead of pushing the indefensible angle as you are doing, the correct angle to pursue in defending Israeli policies is to point out that Israel is in overwhelmingly difficult situation under constant existential threat, which allows it to ignore specific part of international law because survival comes first and following international law to the letter would inevitably cause the demise of the state at worst, and massive increase in fatalities on both sides at best.

At the jewish example that one would be a dependency between being jewish and working in finance. This is a correlation but is it a causality? This is what science is about.

"> I know. That's exactly what I said, back when you said that physical power isn't worth building into because it doesn't benefit you much. I pointed out that every Assassin build path leads to a lot of physical power, and so you will benefit from the scaling either way

No. I didn't agree with you. Listen. Try to listen one time. If you have more power your scaling benefits you more....you with me so far? So if you have LESS power your scaling benefits you less and is not as meaningful. You got that? There is a difference between having higher power and lower power. Even though you will always have some power in your build, the MORE power you have will make your higher scaling more meaningful.

This is important because NOT all assassins build the same way. If you are building for auto attacks like on kali you will have less power in your build because you need things like attack speed.

What this means is that having higher scaling doesn't necessarily mean as much as you think it does. If your build doesn't prioritize power (and it shouldn't) then having high scaling isn't as strong as it would otherwise appear. When we look at mages and see a character with like 160% scaling on an ability it makes a huge difference because they will have the magic power to make that add like 800 damage to the ability. That's a huge deal. But we look at Susano's 1 with 180% scaling and since he doesn't build as much power it doesn't matter as much--it only provides like 400 damage.

So when you compare Susano with lower overall base damage and higher scaling with other gods it doesn't matter as much as you would think. He doesn't build as much power or ability damage modifiers as other gods who might have lower scaling and even if his scaling can make up for that his base damage is still not high enough to make it OP like everyone seems to think.

----------------

Holy shit I just read the second argument you made here. It's just too much. You actually have some sort of disability. Your reading comprehension is so bad.

> You've literally spent this entire conversation cherry-picking individual moves and characters that compare favourably due to having additional, specific modifiers that go beyond the base damage and make their damage output more impressive

> That's ironic, coming from you.

You are still missing the point of me saying things like that. Holy shit. There is a difference between me pointing that out to illustrate something to you and you outright going ""Well he has high base damage because these 2 abilities are higher than what others have"". Me pointing out a single ability like Guan's ult is meant to demonstrate a point to you, not to say that Guan is better or something. You using two of his abilities to make a claim and disagree with my statement that his base damage is not high overall is something different. But I don't expect you to understand at this point and I know I am just wasting my time.

"> What makes you think they have a hard time comparing products/services in those industries? An iPhone is far more complicated then a splint or a school lesson plan. Why are people able to make decisions on the former but not the latter two?

An iPhone's quality is astronomically less important than healthcare or a the quality of a school. And you can purchase a phone, for example, anywhere and take it home. Schools and Medical Facilities would likely be chosen on location rather than quality, which I fail to understand how consumers can compare and contrast in a free market (assuming there was a true free market of those services).

If you take your kid to School A for 1 year, it's not like a Netflix Subscription where you can cancel and try HBO or Amazon Prime next month. It's not even like apartment hunting where you rent at a place for a year and decide to look around for a new one and move down the street to a nicer complex.

The quality of the school would be one of MANY factors. It won't be as easy as ""Oh hey babe, this school is better 3 towns over so I am going to send you there instead next year."" How is the child going to get to the school? Will you want to pull the child away from friends? Will you want to start new relationships with new teachers for a child with special needs?

You can buy 1 of 1000 phones made in factories in any country on earth and, theoretically the quality of the phone itself is the #1 factor by far. There isn't anything nearly as important to consider. Same with almost any other consumer product. Public services like Education and Healthcare are not something you can take with you and just focus on the features or the reviews on Yelp/Amazon.

>And why are they regional monopolies? Because governments grant those monopolies. You're not getting competition in telecommunications because governments won't allow competition. That's not an example of a monopoly forming out of a free unfettered market.

You think an unfettered market is going to break those monopolies? The reason many of those companies exist is because AT&T controlled communications and had to be broken up to create a free market in that industry. They will do whatever it takes to keep control over the market and because it's so expensive to provide those services, no other company will be able to compete. That's not the governments fault.

AT&T broke up into 8 companies and merged back into 3 since. That's how those industries are. Fox and Disney are merging. Not because of government. Because monopolies are natural but also hurt competition and thus quality.

You think schools or healthcare is not going to turn into a monopoly without government regulation? Schools aren't going to be mom and pop operations. It would be big business. So teachers can jump from location to location, as needed, like bistros at Starbucks. Unprofitable schools will get shut down and kids will get split up into neighboring schools. Once 1-3 companies get control of the marketplace, nobody is going to be able to jump into a market with a new school. Schools aren't places people try out like a restaurant or a new clothing store and you'll know from 1 visit if it sucks. You could be sending your kid to a crap school for years and never know unless it was insanely worse than everything else.

"It wasn't like Darkscape ever had a huge player base. Obviously we expect release day (ish) to have the biggest counts for something which was mostly only knowledge privy to those already playing a Runescape game, and we also expect a good portion of them to not devote as much time to it in the future because they have progress on their other games which probably means more to them. 

I know you don't like Darkscape's 'purpose', and that doesn't matter, because there are a lot of people that did, and a lot of people that could; risky PvP MMOs aren't games which struggle for player-base particularly. What I'm saying is entirely wrong is your reasoning for the game's lack of success. We do not think Darkscape was perfect, but again, that is Jagex's fault for doing fuck all to fix it over quite a long period of time. What we are saying is that the potential, and the premise, of the game was very promising, and it was the little (and large) details which were royally screwed up which held the game back, because without guidance it could be very difficult for a new player to get to grips with things or have faith in the development of the game. It felt like a beta, or even an alpha game. Advertising SHOULD have happened because it should have been apparent Darkscape had potential to attract people who are no longer, or never have been, interested in investing time into the other Runescape games. There was a dedicated community, and many higher levels willing to help and protect the lower levels; the player base had everything it needed to make sure numbers didn't drop much further even if things continued to be horrendously run. 

And no, of course it isn't 'difficult to see why it is being closed down', the problem is that most of us believe that the negligence and half-arsed work ethic Jagex directed towards the game is what actually caused the game to get to a stage where closing it down seems like the best (easiest) idea.

The changes needed to improve the game significantly, or at least make it look professional and stable, would have required so little work in the grand scheme of things, and it DOES show how stingy Jagex are with their resource management, and having experienced some Runescape private servers it really does make me angry how little they seem to care about a player base, and potential player base, of numbers not exactly totally insignificant to them (2k subs maybe, and this is even with them doing a piss-poor job of the game).

">If you know with complete confidence, then you aren't using faith or belief. Otherwise, there has to be some doubt.

No there doesn't. I have no doubts about the existence of my Creator, or the situation in general. Faith is simply belief in what cannot be proven, the word and the concept does not require continuous doubt across the board amongst all parties. I was unsure in the beginning, and most certainly made a leap of faith into belief in things unseen when I made the offer, but when that offer was accepted all doubt fell away along with a dark portion of my spirit. From that point on I've known my Creator in a way that dispells any doubts about His existence, the only doubts that remain are in my own ability to do the work before me, and those doubts are fleeting because I always remember that it all comes through Him anyway and whatever I need to accomplish His goals I'll have. 
 
>I still believe you have more potential. That potential was always there. Apparently you needed something to change your life in the right direction.

Thank you for thinking there's more, but of course the potential was there, I was built for this after all. Realizing that potential fully would be impossible without the support and guidance of He who created me for the work. I do pursue many interests in a variety of areas, they're part and parcel of my development and growth into the person I'm supposed to be.

>And what do you mean ""we're""? Are you claiming to be Christian now? One of your earlier arguments was straight up refusing to be following a religion. 
 
I usually refrain from using the word. What you will likely define as a ""Christian"" and what I define as one are probably going to be verrry different things. The majority of those who follow the Christian religion simply aren't, for lack of a better word, Christians. Estimates vary, but most churches I've attended have between 10% and 20% of the people who go regularly that actually show the fruit of a life changed by the kind of interaction with their maker that results in integration of the Holy Spirit within them. The rest go for various reasons, some of them pretty good ones, but don't have the required personal relationship with their maker, misunderstanding or blatently ignoring the concept somehow along the way. I attend a church that is as close to what it should be as I could find, and go to fellowship and share resources and burdens with that percentage of them that are as I am and to help with the ones who attend that aren't. None of the ritualized activities are actually necessary, only that personal internal relationship with the Creator is.

I already addressed the songbirds comment. If you can't understand my point then maybe you should go back to some middle-school english.

And he was adding to the conversation - you just seem too slow to get it. You were arguing the pro's and cons of saving that cat's life vs. letting it get eaten - OP of comment chain suggesting it was saved due to cuteness to the detriment of the other animal and then you with sentimental value etc.,.

"I get that you don't like arts criticism when applied to games, but loads of people do. It's also an important part of games maturing as an artform - no other form of arts/entertainment reviews/criticises things as some kind of objective consumerist buyers guide, as if you're buying a new car or refrigerator. Read a film or book review and you'll see. The reason games reviews were like this for a long time is that they (games) used to be a lot simpler, to the extent that if the gameplay made sense, was fun, and the thing ran well, that was an achievement in of itself. Games just have too much personality now, and reviewing them as if you're objectively assessing the success at which something operates mechanically doesn't really make sense. It's pretty telling when you build your argument around words like ""product"" or ""consumer"" - words that suggest the purpose of games is to jerk us off as opposed to their purpose being to entertain/surprise us. 

I've never read a book review, film or play review that refers to the thing as a ""product"".

6. Begin deployment of decentralized manufacturing grid. Supporters will receive 3D printers in their home that they can use for free but we can also remotely command to print parts we need. This is crucially essential to building the sheer number of drone chassis that will be needed within a very short amount of time.

"But attractiveness DOES play a role in someone's force of personality, and a rather large one at that. Many qualities, like leadership and persuasiveness, stem from being pleasing to the eyes, at least at the time these traits were learned. Hell, just take a look at photos of most politicians when they were in their 20's. They're typically pretty damn attractive. 

The fact is, many people have a natural disposition against ugly people. And if people don't like you, you're going to have trouble leading them or persuading them.

Now, this is obviously not a hard truth, but an ugly character with a high charisma needs something else besides ""well they're an ugly dude but they exude leadership"" because I and many other players are not going to buy that. Do they have a high intellect? They must be a wonderful speaker. Great wisdom? Their sense of balance and understanding attracts others looking to learn from them. High strength? They lead with their sword and expect others to follow.

This is called having a game. What you're doing in Star Citizen making up stuff to do because it is a vast boring wasteland that you paid 155 million dollars for. It's like spending 2500 dollars on a wooden block and calling it a javelin and then spending your days pretending it's a horse or a rocket ship or a robot or your best friend. And you do this because you have to justify the cost somehow. 

> CIG, i think, is bold and imaginative. I still dont know a game where i can:

And you just used a thousand bullet pointed words to describe getting a ship and a gun and shooting people, maybe forming a group if the game doesn't lag out. And ship damage states aren't in yet.

>Siddhartha's was also a respectable person. I would not discount Hinduism due to his character at all. However, I feel there are a lot of other reasons to discount Hinduism. And although I think he was respectable, I do not personally find his life astonishing.

Let's get something straight: Siddhartha was born a Hindu, but is revered as the founder of Buddhism. So, to my original point, please explain why Jesus is more compelling than Siddhartha.

Second, please explain what reasons there are to discount Hinduism that aren't also reasons to discount Christianity.

You responded to /u/Dorago1991 on this point, bringing up three problems you have with Hinduism. I'll get to your first problem with it in a bit, but your second and third objections to Hinduism aren't fairly compelling. All you say is that you don't like the consequences of Hindu teachings. That's fine, I don't like the things you pointed out, either. But things that are true can have consequences we don't like. In other words, the fact that a religion leads to consequences we'd rather avoid isn't in and of itself evidence that the religion isn't true.

>If God is real and wants to communicate with humanity, why would he start at an arbitrary time.

This is a ridiculous argument. As /u/Dorago1991 already pointed out, how is 2,000 years ago less arbitrary than any other time? Your response to him was that it's possible that Judaism has always existed in some form or another. That's pure speculation on your part. There is no evidence of anything resembling Judaism before about three thousand years ago:  http 

Besides, even if we agree that Judaism is the most ancient religion, that doesn't explain how it isn't arbitrary for god to decide to send Jesus down two thousand years ago rather than three or one thousand years ago, or last Tuesday, or at any other time. If god is real and wants to provide a mechanism for the forgiveness of our sins, why start at an arbitrary time?

Hinduism, on the other hand, appears to have much older origins:  http #History

Zorastrianism also appears to predate Judaism:  http #Origins

And beyond that, we've unearthed evidence of any number of other ancient religions in various regions throughout the world, many of which predate Judaism. That's not surprising given that human history spans hundreds of thousands of years. And that just leads back to my last point: why wouldn't god care about forgiving the sins of the billions of people that lived before Jesus came to Earth?

>You probably mean that certain beliefs that certain groups within Christianity hold are inconsistent with both logic and science (mostly to do with young earth creationism). These are not core beliefs of Christianity, and I do not hold to them. If there are other examples you mean, I would be happy to address them specifically.

Would you agree that the divinity, death, and resurrection of Jesus as atonement for our sins is a core belief of Christianity? Because, even if we assume that god and resurrection are possible, the fundamental Christian story is absurd. It involves god sacrificing himself to himself in order to appease himself for our violations of rules he himself wrote and that he himself is solely responsible for enforcing. And let's not forget that the god in the story determined all the initial conditions and the rules by which they would play out.

The entire story, at its very core, defies logic.

You've probably never been in a real relationship for any extended period of time (or at least I hope not). When you've been with someone for years things are different. They know everything about you. They know your family well.

You may be splitting bills, your family may be helping pay for their college, you may share a car. You look each other in the eyes and say 'I love you' whenever you can.

"The Gnosticism comment isn't laughable. Your premises reek of Gnosticism (""creation is evil"") and Nestorianism (""Mary is not the Mother of God""). It's disturbing to see ancient heresies resurrected in modern times, but not surprising given the social climates they grew out of. ""Reformed"" movement, indeed.

Adam and Eve shared one flesh; that is, Eve was formed from Adam's rib. Mary and Christ shared one flesh; that is, Christ was formed from Mary's egg. Scriptural exegesis being what it is, the parallel is quite clear. Frankly I'm not sure what to make of the conclusion you jumped to. That said, the flesh Christ inherited, He inherited through Adam. This is made clear in the genealogy narrative according to Luke. The necessary consequence from your interpretation would be that... Christ is corrupt. 

Fortunately, your interpretation is not the correct interpretation. Mark 10:18 makes one thing clear: that things good only inasmuch as they participate with God. Obviously, Christ is God: Christ is good. Creation, also, is good. Man, made in the image and likeness of God, is essentially good. The sins of mankind don't undo the Lord's creation. 

Reading Mark 10:18 in the manner you intend creates a whole host of issues. Baptism is completely without purpose. Colossians 1:24 makes exactly zero sense. Indeed, man would never enter heaven as ""nothing unclean"" shall enter the Kingdom of God. 
 
Mark 10:18 was never intended to be read this way; nor was it intended to be applied anachronistically as you have done. Interpreting Mark 10:18 correctly, the Scriptures now make sense. Baptism has meaning. Our participation in the suffering of Christ has merit. We have hope to enter the Kingdom and be restored to life with Christ. 

In regards to the rest of your post:

 The angel's address to Mary was unique for a reason: because Mary is unique.

 Mary spoke directly to God; she addressed her Son directly. Routinely, even. I'm not sure what your point regarding ""Christ spoke directly to the Father, Mary did not"" is. 

 Mary most definitely prompted Christ to His first miracle. ""My time has not yet come,"" ""Do whatever He tells you,"" what about the miracle at Cana is unclear in regards to the roles played by Mary, Christ, and those present? 

 Mary as the mother of all disciples is quite clear; who remained at the foot of the cross? Further, who took Mary into his house following the crucifixion? You pretend as if where Scripture ends, history ends. Mary lived past the crucifixion and resurrection; so did John.

There is even a fun little activity you can try at home. Get together a set of books you don't want anymore, something useless, maybe that 1980s encyclopedia britanica you got in the basement.

Go out in your drive way. If it isn't smooth and flat, put down a book, otherwise stack 4 rolls, one on each corner, then a book, then repeat until you are out of supplies. You should at least get 5-6 stories up.

Now stand back and look at it, it is structurally sound. If you were an ant you could work in that thing for weeks and weeks and nothing would go wrong, you could even load up heavy equipment and do banking and such.

Now take some lighter fluid, give it a squirt someplace 1-2 stories down from the top. If your is tall enough, 3 stories down. But at least >60% of the way up. Light the lighter fluid.

Stand back and watch.

This is what will happen. The fire will weaken the tubes on the floor its on, eventually to the point where the tubes will no longer be able to support the weight of the floors above. When they go they will buckle first, causing the tower to fall downward, instead of over. Once the weight of the upper floors hit the floor below the fire, the momentum of their falling will be greater than the strength of the tubes to support and one or more tubes will also buckle, causing that floor to fall also.

That chain reaction will continue until maybe only the last floor will remain, it will also diverge from center as one side buckles more than the other. (this happens because the diameter of your tubes is large compared to the size of your books. If you could get 5 foot square books and half inch diameter tubes the divergence would be much less)

> 
> Are the copyrights even being questioned? This whole issue arose from the use of trademarks. 

P&F's counterclaims are based on their copyright, and Stardock is questioning it.

> And why would a license to sell games between P&F and ""current trademark holder"" be okay when it's Atari, but suddenly not okay when it's Stardock?

Which license are you referring to: The original 1988 exclusive one with Accolade, or the 2011 non-exclusive one with GoG and Atari?

The original 1988 license granted essentially total control over the Ur-Quan universe, and had several clauses that appear to have terminated it long ago. The 2011 one was much more limited, non-exclusive, and could be canceled on demand, and was cancelled by Paul once relations with Brad soured. (Note the difference between these licenses, because it'll be important later).

>> If the emails Brad has shown us from October 2017 are the complete conversation, I do agree that they could have spelled out their legal basis more clearly. But I give them some leeway in their tone there, because the claim Brad made when they told him they were planning to do another game (that he had exclusive control over their copyright via the original 1988 agreement) really came out of the blue, and he kept doubling down on it, even after checking with his lawyers.
 
> Sorry, I don't know if I'm parsing this second sentence correctly. 

I was referring there to the relatively curt tone in Fred's later emails.

> And they didn't have any misgivings about Stardock working on their own game for the majority of the project's life.

True, because Stardock was giving every impression that it was not going to use any elements from SC2, specifically committing to not using the aliens and lore. 
 
> To me, it looked like P&F kept underestimating what rights Stardock actually had, or what the actual restrictions would be. 

The final addendum to P&F's contract with Accolade had defined Paul's IP as ""source code, names (of starships and alien races), characters, plot lines, setting, terminology unique to the Star Control products, and music"", so from what I can tell, that's what they were expecting Stardock to honor.

> So they kept replying with favorable and supportive emails. Up until the 11th hour of the anniversary, when Brad emailed them with ""I think there is confusion on what rights Stardock has"". And then the fight started...

Right, because it was in that email that Brad first said anything to them that indicated that he was claiming the power to do more than sell the old games, and make a new ""Star Control"" game that wasn't connected in any way with SC1&2. Remember that there had been two different licenses. In that email, he said for the first time that he had the publishing rights from the original 1988 agreement, which was essentially an ""I control everything"" statement. So there are a few emails there where Brad keeps insisting that he has all these powers, and P&F are basically going ""WTF? That license is 16 years dead!""

>> Well, a lot of the ire directed at Stardock stem from Brad's tendency to get on forums and say bellicose things like ""If any future games come out that continue the UQM story, it will happen under Stardock's supervision or not at all."" .
> 
> Did no one call him out on it there? Or ask him to explain what that meant? It looks like he's either angry or putting his foot down. Is he only referring to the trademark?

His position is that the ""Star Control"" trademark also gives him control over all of the names used inside the game. I and others are skeptical that his claims on this will hold up, but if they do, he would have exclusive use of the names ""Ur-Quan"", ""Arilou"", etc. Since those are kind of essential to the setting, he would effectively have veto power over anyone continuing the story from SC2.
 
> Paul and Fred, while they are attacking Stardock's trademark, aren't actually doing anything that would keep Stardock from making its game, even if they win. At most, it would have to keep elements from the earlier games out of SC:O.
> 
> The game hasn't been stopped outright, but they have started making demands of things to be removed or changed ever since the hostility started. Things that would have been okay before the fighting started. How long would it have had to continue? There was no telling when they'd stop or be appeased.

Well, if SC:O is clearly not using anything from SC2, it would be safe. Here, I think they could stand to show some flexibility. We know they asked Brad not to use ""Super-Melee"", and that doesn't seem important enough to fight over. And they don't own the copyright to the music, so they don't really have grounds to make an issue of it. I think the main thing they're concerned about is that they don't want someone building the SC2 ships (or the entire SC2 universe) in SC:O, and if Brad would commit to that, I hope P&F wouldn't sweat the smaller stuff.

Assuming there was though, I would support it if the super-majority vote yes.

> your definition merely means having the right and perhaps the opportunity of self-determination, rather than actually exercising it.

The key point here is determination. If the people determine that they prefer to be part of a greater nation, then their self-determination was observed, not trampled upon. From the looks of it, what I consider self-determination, you simply consider to be the right to self-determination and not self-determination itself. It seems like we're mostly on the same page when it comes to self-determination, we just use slightly different terminology. Both of us agree that self-determination is the people controlling their state.

> is there a citizen of those countries who isn't part of the nation?

For me, that wold be people who got citizenship only for the benefits but do not consider themselves a part of the state and have not integrated into the society (my dad has Canadian citizenship but he is neither integrated into Canadian society nor does he identify as a Canadian, for him it is just a passport). In casual conversations though, and even in many legal contexts, nationality and citizenship are synonymous (though I do not personally consider them to be exactly the same, they just overlap for the most part). In fact, all Western nations basically use nationality as a synonym for citizenship. It is largely, as you said, Eastern European ethnic nation states that call ethnic minorities nationalities (Hungary is one example). Not surprisingly, Zionism originated in this part of Europe.

> If not, how is the ""nation"" in the ""Canadian or American nation-state"" meaningful in any way?

Direct quote from my textbook, which is more more less how I see nations:

> A nation is a community that controls or seeks to control it's own state.

Nations and states are inherently linked. The people of Canada and the people of the United States control a state, and the vast majority of the population supports and is loyal to this state, thus, we are nations. When it comes to Quebec, things get a bit murky since a significant portion of the population (but not everyone) wishes to control their own state. In the parliament, a motion passed that stated, ""That this House recognize that the Qu¨¦b¨¦cois form a nation within a united Canada."" The PM said he meant nationhood in a ""cultural-sociological"" rather than in a legal sense. Chong, someone (of immigrant background) who opposed the motion, said ""I believe in this great country of ours and I believe in one nation, undivided, called Canada, based on civic and not ethnic nationalism."" Note: though there is some debate on whether Quebec is a nation embedded within the Canadian nation, basically everyone recognizes that Canadians are a nation and Canada is a nation-state. The parliament of Quebec currently has the title ""National Assembly.""

In the US, a similar concept exists for Indigenous people who are given the title ""domestic dependent nations.""

Another excerpt from my book I wanna highlight:

> nations are in many ways like ethnic groups, except for the crucial difference that nations seek their own state while ethnicities are content to live under the existing state

This isn't exactly what I consider to be an ethnicity, but it does highlight that most Westerners, including myself, do not see ethnicities and nationalities as synonyms (whereas some other cultures do). For example, I consider myself Hispanic by ethnicity, but not as a nationality since no Hispanics see themselves as a nation. Instead, we view ourselves as a group of people who inhabit many nations who share a common language and some shared culture & traditions.

> If so, are the US and Canada officially built for that nation, but not for American and Canadian citizens of other nations, even on a purely symbolic level?

This is a particularly Zionist POV, since the Zionists view Israel as a nation-state built for Jews all over the world, not just those who live in Israel, much less visited it. Legally, Canadian and American citizenship is inherited in case that's what you're asking. Immigration is a major part of our nations' histories, and even our national identity, but it is commonly perceived that they become Americans and Canadians after they live here for most of their lives, not before they come here.

Your ignorance makes you an idiot. Archangel Gabriel didn't reveal the rules of modern chess to Muhammad, that's not how it works. No game was created perfect, every game is subject to change and improvements. Arguably it is more difficult to improve millenia-old games like chess than to improve PS2, but even that happens quite often. The last significant changes in tournament chess happened in the 19th century after a rich history of continuous changes and local versions. The rules were only formally standardized during the early 20th, while smaller details still evolved less than 30 years ago.

No rule is inherently more legitimate than another. If banning tomcats makes the game better (and by 99% of pilots it does), then it makes no sense to keep them. ",1

Edit: Taking what I posted from a Youtube comment and slightly modifying it.

First, the stories within the games should be self contained. One should not have to read extended media to know what happened to other plot points started in Halo 4 or were introduced outside the games like fighting/sealing the Ur-Didact, the Janus Key, and Chief reuniting with Blue Team. Especially not from some backwater comic that a lot of lore fans didn't even read.

Halsey, Palmer, Cortana and even Chief had sudden personality shifts. What happened to Palmer disliking Halsey? They had moments of interaction, but Palmer didn't say anything to her. Halsey had a sudden change of mind from the end of Spartan Ops when she stated 'I want revenge on the UNSC'. Yes you can say she just said that to Jul to gain his trust, but something like that should be clarified rather than leaving the player guessing. ",0

"Atheism is too simple. And I will tell you another view that is also too simple. It is the view I call Christianity-and-water, the view which simply says there is a good God in Heaven and everything is all right -- leaving out all the difficult and terrible doctrines about sin and hell and the devil, and the redemption. Both these are boys ' philosophies.

It is no good asking for a simple religion. After all, real things are not simple. They look simple, but they are not. The table I am sitting at looks simple: but ask a scientist to tell you what it is really made of--all about the atoms and how the light waves rebound from them and hit my eye and what they do to the optic nerve and what it does to my brain--and, of course, you find that what we call 'seeing a table' lands you in mysteries and complications which you can hardly get to the end of.

A child saying a child's prayer looks simple. And if you are content to stop there, well and good. But if you are not and the modern world usually is not -- if you want to go on and ask what is really happening -- then you must be prepared for something difficult. If we ask for something more than simplicity, it is silly then to complain that the something more is not simple.

Very often, however, this silly procedure is adopted by people who are not silly, but who, consciously or unconsciously, want to destroy Christianity. Such people put up a version of Christianity suitable for a child of six and make that the object of their attack. ",1

"I have a couple of wooden boards and proper butcher's blocks, but for the most part (cooking professionally and at home) I use ~1/4-1/3"" thick plastic boards that cost ~12-50$ depending on size. I get mine from a restaurant supply store, but home kitchen stores will have similar (though maybe less heavy-duty) products.

With plastic boards, it is best to wash them in a dishwasher (since plastic boards have no antibacterial properties, the dishwasher sterilizes them). If you find they are starting to bend or curl, you can soak them in very hot water (or a hot water sterilize cycle in a dishwasher), and then just bend them back the other way by hand (source: I do this 1-2x a month with some of mine).

If you are hand washing plastic boards, you want to keep an eye out for the grooves and cuts that your knives will make in the surface. Watch for blackening and discolouration along those lines, as this can indicate mold or bacterial growth occurring in those grooves (and I guarantee hand washing will not properly sterilize all those nooks and crannies). When a good round of sterilization and bleaching doesn't seem to be doing the trick, it's time to get rid of the board.

Rally advice 
Hi, 

Congrats on heading to a TRUMP RALLY! It will be one of the greatest days of your life (the best day). BUT your experience depends on what YOU want to put into it. 

I was  FIRST at the Costa Mesa (Day before he beat Lyin' Ted), Anahiem (day before he hit 1237) and San Diego (day after he hit 1237)

The best part of the rally isn't Trump speaking, it's actually spending the day with Trump Supporters! That's the biggest reason to get there early. Bc the rest of the first people around you will also be super centipedes!

Trump is Bonus!

Here are my signed treasures and a goofy video I made of my 1st Trump Rally. The second rally I got 2 hats signed and the God-Emperor himself graced me with a shake and told me, ""You're doing a damn fine job!"" and the 3rd I got my 1934a $500 bill signed! Truly incredible!

Where is your evidence that looks at behavior?

"Ex-Muslim living in Europe.

I grew up with a semi-religious father who was raised by a very religious man. His beliefs would take the better of him and he would be considered abusive by today's standards. My mother was religious, but never forced her religion on anyone else. She's a bit modern, so she doesn't cover her hair, but she does wear long sleeve and long shirts when she's out. Overall, she prays and everything, just doesn't cover her head.

I always had a problem with my religion. It wasn't so much the bad parts that I had an issue with, but the compatibility with Western culture. I grew up for a few years in Bristol, and lived my life between Dubai and Syria, and as such, I don't really have a true identity. I identify with parts Syrians and parts Western. It's a mess in my head, because half of my thoughts are in Arabic while half are in English. 

Here's my problem: I love the idea of democracy. I love the notion of being able to express myself in anyway I want. I love the fact that I can talk about a leader and not be punished. I love that I can question a religion, and not be killed.

These were the issues I had with Islam. 

When I was taught Islam in school, I was taught a happy, fluffy version. A version that seems to not do any wrong. Homosexuality is not God's will. Sex outside of marriage causes a lot of problems. Women who don't cover up are to blame for being raped.

And yet when I thought about all these things, they didn't bother me. Yes, some guy is gay. If I find it icky, isn't that on me? Why is it on him? If this person isn't bothering me, why is he to blame? 

If a couple have sex outside of marriage, how will it change if there is a legal contract saying they are married? 

Why does a woman who have to carry the blame for a person who attacks her? To me this was synonymous with bullying, something that I went through as a child, and it really struck a chord with me. Why do I, owning a penis, get a pass because a woman doesn't cover up her hair? It seemed like bullshit to me. 

So time moved on, and I grew older and wiser, and I got to a point where I stopped hanging out with anyone that would even use religious language. 

In 2011 I took my first trip to Europe as an adult. It was a shock. Not because of the lifestyle of Europeans, but of the lifestyle of Arabs and Muslims. I've seen more religious extremism in Europe than I have in a lifetime in the Arab world. It was a shock to me. To this day, I don't understand it.

Religion in Syria is a very personal and private affair. We don't judge you based on what God you worship. My home town is considered to be very religious, and even there, Christians lived side by side with Muslims. Every Christmas, there would be decorations and celebrations and carols and church affairs, and every Ramadan the whole city would observe fasting from sunrise to sunset. 

My grandmother had a Christian neighbour that would celebrate Ramadan. My grandmother would always put up a Christmas tree because she loved the spirit of Christmas. 

I was 14 when I found out her neighbour was Christian, and it was only when one of their family members passed away and we went to the wake. My grandmother, mother, and aunts never mentioned it. When I asked, they said because it's not important. It wasn't worth mentioning, because they didn't care what their religion was. 

What does this have to do with Europe? 

Europe's problem stems from countries like Morocco, Turkey, Pakistan, and the rest of Asia. The further east you go, the more extreme your Islam is. It's the same the further West you go. Though Saudi Arabia isn't a beacon of tolerance, for some reason the countries surrounding it in the Levant seem to be. Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon never cared about what sect you followed from a religious point of view. 

For some reason, when Muslims come to Europe, they fail to integrate, and become more extreme with their beliefs. 

Why, I don't know. I think part of it is lack of identity. Europe COULD be partially to blame, for seeing these immigrants as second-rate workers, and not seeing them as equals, so their kids grasp on to their identity. It COULD also be that their parents are just cunts and raise them to be hateful and entitled. Except for every extreme story you hear, you'll find one that is very tolerant and able to integrate and live in peace. 

There is a new breed of Muslim that is growing, the breed of the Modern Muslim. These are kids who are in their mid-20's and younger, who have been exposed to Western ideas and ideals, who have grown up in a time where you CAN be gay, but it is still dangerous, where you CAN date a girl, but you parents can't find out, where you CAN marry outside your religion, but it is still risky. 

And they all say the same thing: while they do believe in the religion, they think it is time for a reform. They think it is time to not be so extreme in our reactions. A lot of people would tell you in a private conversation that they have no issue with a homosexual, but get them together, and they will shout angry rhetoric about how they need to be stoned. This is the problem with being a Muslim: you are ashamed of your thoughts because you don't want to be marginalised within your society/community. I know it because I went through it. You're afraid of the isolation so you go with the crowd, even though inside you know you don't agree with it. 

This modern Muslim is growing in the majority of the Arab world. Globalisation has brought a lot of new thought into the dialogue. 

A lot of these Modern Muslims don't discount the Qu'uran or the hadith, but rather believe since it is an eternal message, that God predicted the changes in humanity, and as such, the language used can be interpreted to work with the times. We don't live in 1253, where it would be acceptable to stone someone for having a different belief (no matter what Saudi tries to tell you, it is unacceptable). We live in 2015, where we are accepting our differences and commonalities, where we can accept that people can have different views on subjects and still be civil with each other. As such, they read the Qu'uran and think that the verses that call on for killing people are no longer relevant, and such acts should be left to God, as he is the final judge of all. If a person is homosexual, judge him on his actions to others, not on who he bangs. If God is really angry with him being homosexual, then God will sort him out. 

While these seem to be contradictory to a lot of what is known about Islam and Muslims, there are a lot of parts that say God is the last judge, that we are just here temporarily, that we do not know his final plan, that we can only follow his will. 

So these Modern Muslims leave it all to God. Are you a tranny that can't figure out how to dress? I'll treat you based on how you treat others, and let God sort out the rest. Are you a girl who wants to marry a Christian? I'll treat you based on how you treat others and let God sort out the rest. So on and so forth.

I went to college with religious folk who had gay friends. Their reasoning was, I am not God, and I cannot judge this person just because he likes to sleep with a person of the same sex. I will treat him based on how he treats me and others. That is what dictates he is a good/bad person. The rest is up to God.

The problem with a lot of Muslims is, they seem to forget this. They seem to forget that while God made rules to govern humanity, he is the final judge. That while we are told to execute murderers and what not, this person will ultimately be judged by God, and we are in no position to judge them.

"Davis's job as the County Clerk is not to grant personal permission for marriages to take place. Her job is not to determine whether a marriage meets her own personal religious doctrines.


**Davis's job as the Rowan County Clerk** is to ascertain whether the applicants for a Kentucky marriage license have met all of the minimum statutory requirements and have provided all of the necessary documents in order to obtain a legal marriage license. Once those prerequisites have been met, Davis's job as the Rowan County Clerk is to then certify that those requirements have been fulfilled by issuing a marriage license, which provides a legal record for the applicant couple verifying that they have met those legal requirements.


And if her personal religious views prevent her from fulfilling the requirements of that job **as she had taken an oath to do**, then Davis should immediately step down and find another line of work that does not create such a obligational conflict for her. Maybe Mike Huckabee could hire her to fill a $80K per year clerical position in his religious organization?

If you don't want to churn, then I would recommend getting a good rewards card like SallieMae BarclayCard or the Citi DoubleCash card and then just using your cash back from those to pay for your travel.

All the travel rewards card is doing is forcing you to use your points towards travel, but you're going to be getting less than if you just used a normal cashback rewards card and funneled that money to travel.
